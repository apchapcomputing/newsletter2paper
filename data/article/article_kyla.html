<p>Good morning from the woods!</p>
<p>Two days ago, I fell off my bike. We were on an incredible trail, perfectly chunky with rocks and just wide enough. I
    took my eyes off the trail for a second - to ask if everyone else was enjoying the trail as much as I was - and the
    bike slid out from under me. I was totally okay, but the derailleur, the bike’s gearing system, was completely bent
    out of shape. </p>
<p>So there I was, halfway up a hill, with a bike that could only operate in one gear. I could pedal, but I couldn't
    shift. I could maybe move forward, but only with tremendous, inefficient effort.</p>
<p>And to carry a metaphor here - the US economy is sort of like that bike. It's moving, but its gearing system is
    completely out of whack. The US is operating with 3 broken gears that no longer connect. There are currently 3
    Americas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>America 1 (The Speculative Class):</strong> The first America is the speculative class, and its
            engine is artificial intelligence. The Magnificent 7 are spending over $100 billion a quarter on data
            centers, which are these monumental projects of hope. They consume vast amounts of capital and electricity,
            a place where money and power are absorbed in a high-stakes gamble.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>America 2 (The Real Economy):</strong> The second America is the real economy. With 75% of new jobs
            in healthcare and social assistance, our workforce is being absorbed by the essential but underfunded
            ‘maintenance economy’ of an aging population. While it props up the labor market, it fails to generate the
            type of wealth that fuels the stock market or long-term growth, as resources are poured into maintenance
            rather than creation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>America 3 (The Memes):</strong> The third America is the bridge between the other two, acting
            somewhat as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink">psychological gold sink </a>for those who
            are priced out of a house and a future. The money spent here is largely speculative and doesn't build a
            sustainable future (is memecoin investing productive, I don’t know) but it gives people a sense of agency
            and hope within a system that otherwise offers them little.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a very strange world.</p>
<h3>America 1: The Speculative Class (AI) </h3>
<p>Let’s start with the gear that gets all the attention - the one that's supposed to be powering us into the glorious
    future, the world of AI. </p>
<p>AI is weird. <a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/how-ai-conquered-the-us-economy-a">Derek Thompson</a> wrote a
    nice piece on the good and efficient parts of AI, noting that it’s making workers more productive (or at least, the
    workers <em>think</em> so), changing our language (delve), and absorbing a massive amount of cash. But there’s also
    the <em>psychological</em> impacts of AI:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>People are getting addicted to it</strong> and it could be breaking brains: OpenAI rolled out a new
            version of the model, changing <a href="https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/">some of its
                sycophantic tendencies </a>(where it would tell you how smart and beautiful you were, not matter what
            you said). It was feeding people’s delusions and causing <a
                href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=chat+gpt+psychosis&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">“Chat-GPT
                induced psychosis”</a>! That’s not a tool that we need during the age of everythingspiracy!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>It could also making people <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872">stupider</a></strong>,
            inserting itself between us and the real world, creating a “technological wedge” as Ewan Morrison <a
                href="https://x.com/MrEwanMorrison/status/1949746907238064489">describes</a>, and potentially (?) taking
            all the jobs (or at least the narrative of jobs) - outside of healthcare, at least. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>It is impacting both how students learn</strong> (perhaps, making it so they don’t learn at all) and
            <strong>the<a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/business/video/ai-job-market-college-grads-audie-cornish-digvid">
                    jobs they might get</a></strong> (perhaps, taking their jobs). And interestingly, in the chart
            below, OpenAI usage drops off around June 6th - around the same time that schools let out. AI is perhaps a
            school tool above all else.
        </p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1953124372480180550">Google</a> knows this - they are providing Gemini for
    free for students for a year and investing $1b in AI and career training for every college student in America. </p>
<p>It’s just so strange! How we teach students are going to have to change (more written in-classroom essays and a
    bigger focus on process over outcome) but overall, everyone has more questions than answers right now - is AI the
    next iteration of the Internet? Is it simply here to give all of us infinite boyfriends and girlfriends? Will it
    replace the entire employee population at Salesforce? All three? Who knows! But while we're still figuring out if AI
    is breaking our brains, we're betting the entire economy on it. </p>
<h4>AI is making things more expensive but it’s propping up the economy</h4>
<p>AI takes a lot of power. It’s putting huge pressure on the consumer, with electricity <a
        href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1952756101356650974">costs ticking upwards</a> at the same time that
    Trump decides there is no need for renewable energy. (Tyler Norris has a good read <a
        href="https://www.powerpolicy.net/p/data-centers-could-make-or-break">here</a> saying (1) yes the higher
    electricity costs are data centers and (2) here’s how we can fix it). </p>

    who is this for? What is it really supposed to do? I don’t know if anyone really knows. I like elements of AI (I
    wish that everyone would stop being like “let’s replace artists” and instead say like “how can we help people order
    medicine) and think it has a future but it’s confusing. </p>

<p>The economy is dependent on data centers really working and <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/06/economy-jobs-middle-class-recession-tariffs/">continued
        consumption by the very wealthy</a> as Heather Long wrote about recently. There is no in-between. </p>
<h4>What about a world beyond AI?</h4>
<p>And as we are funneling a ton of money into AI, at the same time, we have seemingly decided to pass off all other
    science and innovation to China. They are now completely winning - 13 of the top 20 research institutions in the
    world are now Chinese. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/">No.1 on the
        2025 Nature Index</a>, beating Harvard. </p>
<p>It’s internal destruction. China is winning and the US is actively losing. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>RFK Jr just cancelled <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1952879471981379624">mRNA vaccine research,</a> very
            real and important work that could have helped treat cancer. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Science funding has been cut by 50% in the US. We were once the gold standard for important research and now
            that China is closing in, the administration has responded by gutting the National Institute of Health and
            the National Science Foundation. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>But the pendulum is of course swinging back - Doge fired 550 people at National Weather Service, and now
            there is special permission to hire 450 people to <a

<p>This weird one-step-forward-one-step-back is also why China is more popular than the United States right now - the US
    offers nothing more than AI and various types of gambling and volatile tariffs, whereas China has offered massive
    advancements in science and technology and a future that people can actually believe in. China is succeeding because
    of its outsized investment in the future and the US is failing. As Albert Pinto <a

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Simultaneously living in the past (the focus on the energy of the a different era, like fossil fuels and
            coal)</p>

    <li>
        <p>Trying to manifest new technology to save itself in the future. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>But that technology requires the <em>energy</em> of the future - solar, nuclear (not on the moon, probably),
            and wind (Heatmap has a great read on that <a
                href="https://heatmap.news/energy/trump-wind-total-war">here</a>). </p>

</ul>
<p>We need to live in the future to build the future!</p>

    the US (the trick here is to simply announce that you’re moving production to the US). TSMC is <a

<h4>What happens when you isolate all your trading partners? </h4>
<p>The rest of the world is trying to move on without us (one example out of many - Japan is turning to Brazil for beef

        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/brazil-japan-beef-talks-focus-smaller-brazilian-states-upsetting-industry-2025-08-05/">now</a>).
    Tim Sahay and Kate Mackenzie wrote in <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/brics-in-2025/">BRICS in
        2025</a> about how the world is trying to get away from the US at the moment:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The postwar geopolitical order rested on three pillars: American hegemony, the fossil-fuel energy system, and an
        open, multilateral trading order. America has now attacked each pillar at the foundation of its hydrocarbon
        global order. There are now two competing global models of energy and influence: one based on fossil fuels, one
        on green technologies and a new model of sustainable development. China’s technology is finding new markets
        around the world because lots of people want it. But there is so far no real wraparound support of finance,
        trade, and tech transfer—as no new international order of sustainable governance has yet been built.</p>

<p>This ties into what Gillian Tett <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/762c79d2-f9c9-4e68-9a9c-bcfd443ad63e">wrote</a>
    about a few weeks ago - the “core thesis is that China today has hegemonic control of manufacturing (via its
    dominance of key supply chain nodes such as rare earth minerals) but the US has hegemonic control of finance
    (because of the dollar’s reserve currency status).” The US still has the dollar, even after all of this. We are
    still the financial stronghold. But for how much longer?</p>
<p>As the US is ramping up “mercantilism and isolationism” to try and throttle China Tett notes that “in places such as
    Asia, cross-border trade is still rising; for many countries globalisation is far from dead”. Other countries know
    what works - comparative advantage, free trade, trading with China - and are following that!</p>
<p>The US seems to developing a data-center driven economy that works for the very few at the expense of many (Noah
    Smith has an interesting read on the risks of that <a
        href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">here</a>). Spend or sink. The problem
    is, the world might not need another round of software and information technology - and instead it might need the
    things that <em>power</em> those things like renewable energy and resource efficiency, which China is focused on and
    the image above shows.</p>
<p>In the meantime, America 2 grapples with a very different reality.</p>
<h3>America 2: The Real Economy (Healthcare)</h3>

<p>Healthcare is where the jobs are, but it’s not where the money goes. It’s Nancy Fraser’s <a

    stocks are one of the worst performing sectors this year. That's mostly because healthcare costs are still
    unmanageable for both the patient and the service provider, and despite being the only sector adding jobs, there are
    still <a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/healthcare-stocks.html">workforce
        shortages. </a></p>

<p>It’s a very clear example of the fundamental disconnect between the stock market and the economy. And that’s the
    important thing - we have these two parallel worlds, both:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Replacement economy in the form of what AI has promised itself to </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Maintenance economy that is designed to care for our aging population.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>This creates an interesting push and pull - the healthcare economy is exceptionally stable, dependent on an aging
    population and continued health problems (and solutions, like GLP-1 drugs). The technological economy is blowing
    through cash (Meta has about $12 billion in cash left after burning through $30 billion the last two quarters) and
    creating a product that hasn’t <em>really</em> found a fit quite yet. </p>
<p>So then a bunch more questions - Do we end up in a real world where people are at a <a
        href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/mark-zuckerberg-wants-ai-glasses-20798250.php">cognitive
        disadvantage</a> if they don’t use Meta’s AI glasses? What happens when many of the jobs are in maintenance
    rather than creation? AI can certainly help healthcare, and it is, but what happens next? </p>
<h3>America 3: Memes</h3>
<p>So we have AI, right, the big shiny thing that the US is betting its entire economy on as it isolates itself from the
    world - and then we have healthcare, where an extraordinary amount of resources are going to have to go (and again,
    AI can likely help here, but it will require an immense amount of labor). Joe Weisenthal, of the very famous podcast
    Odd Lots,<a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1951306138751795467"> wrote about the bifurcated economy, stating
        that</a> the rise of healthcare and AI:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Makes it easy to envision what a stagflationary environment looks like: an economy that exhibits mediocre growth
        across many sectors, but which sustains a fairly high level of resource utilization, because there’s so much
        demand for social assistance (soaking up labor) and demand for electricity and certain types of industrial gear
        (soaking up capital) due to the AI buildout</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does everyone else do? What about the <em>trifurcated</em> economy? What about people that are shut out by
    AI and don’t touch the healthcare economy? What do they do?</p>
<p> Bet? </p>

        meme stocks </a>have started bubbling again - acting somewhat as a psychological gold sink. Goldman Sachs

    tweeted that their campaign was “the hottest ad out there” (it erased almost all of those gains the next day). But
    it’s more than just that. </p>
<p>This is the Labubu/Fartcoin economy - the attempt to maintain agency and community within constraints rather than
    spending energy fighting battles with<a

    AI. There are two core things to understand here"“</p>

            </a>functionally plush bunnies with plastic people faces and the pointed teeth of a jack-o-lantern. They are
            sold in blind-box packaging (you don’t choose them, you open a box and receive your fate) by a Chinese
            company called Pop Mart (There's something strangely poetic about importing economic nihilism from China
            too. We're buying blind-box toys from the country that just overtook Harvard in research output. They sell
            us $15 mystery boxes while they build the actual future!) Over the past six months, they’ve generated almost
            $1 billion in sales. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Gamification</strong>: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fartcoin/">Fartcoin</a> is a
            memecoin born out of an AI project called Truth Terminal. It launched in late 2024, reached a peak $2
            billion market cap in January 2025, and now sits at about $1 billion. It increasingly appears to be an
            alternative to the risk-free asset of US Treasuries. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Labubu and Fartcoin are the economy people can actually participate in. They’re a form of symbolic participation,
    what happens when ownership is out of reach and when expression replaces accumulation. </p>
<p>Both represent a form of <em>aspirational displacement</em>. This is the idea that when you can't afford a house, you
    buy mystery boxes that might contain a rare variant and then that’s good enough. It’s a way to perform relationship
    to consumer culture. When you feel shut out of institutions, you buy meme coins that turn financial nihilism into a
    form of cultural expression.</p>
<p>Conor Sen has talked about this idea a lot, pointing out that consumption is contributing far less to GDP growth now
    than it was in the late 1990s. Nick Magguilli wrote <a
        href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/its-the-housing-stupid/">about the idea recently</a> too. He essentially says
    that people (who would normally buy a house) are throwing money into financial assets because housing is just too
    expensive. </p>

<p>Memecoins and mystery boxes are a way for people to feel they are participating in the boom, even as they are priced
    out of its tangible rewards. When institutional financial advice assumes you have disposable income, long time
    horizons, and faith in market stability – none of which apply to most young people<a class="footnote-anchor"
        data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-anchor-7" target="_self">7</a> – meme
    coins become a rational way to engage with financial markets as you’re betting on volatility rather than growth.

<p>Something that troubles me is the idea that maybe everything is becoming financialized because financial markets are
    the last remaining system capable of aggregating distributed information and enabling coordination at scale. Like
    obviously the above example<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" href="#footnote-8"
        id="footnote-anchor-8" target="_self">8</a> is wild and absurd, but it’s a very efficient form of communication.
    And when traditional institutions (media, education, political parties, local communities) lose credibility, people
    turn to markets for economic coordination and for truth discovery. </p>
<p>And the institutions are losing credibility. <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/023b5ad5-b946-486d-a55f-36a9a9f62443">Trump fired the head of the Bureau of
        Labor Statistics </a>after we got a not great jobs report, which is (1) not great (2) threatens the trust of US
    data (3) subsequently threatens the trust in the US dollar and US Treasuries. The same day that happened, Federal
    Reserve governor Adriana Kugler resigned, giving Trump the chance to nominate a<a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/023b5ad5-b946-486d-a55f-36a9a9f62443"> ‘shadow Fed chair’ </a>which creates
    even more uncertainty (right now, <a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1953232369974165593">two Kevins</a>
    are in the running). </p>
<p>Las Vegas tourism is declining and people are like “oh the<a href="https://x.com/nypost/status/1952766875236012199">
        young Americans</a> are at fault” which ignores that (1) betting is different than gambling and (2) the US is
    becoming Las Vegas - but everywhere. We are essentially building a glorified, speculative fantasy while China
    focuses on the foundational, "boring" work of scientific and technological advancement. </p>
<h3>The Three Americas</h3>
<p>So those are the three Americas. Stocks are just chugging along, driven by AI and memes. There is excitement over
    lower interest rates (at what cost, who knows) and <a
        href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-06/goldman-trader-says-buoyant-stocks-are-ignoring-recession-risks">liquidity</a>.
    And the stock market can look past all sorts of problems, because all it really needs to care about is data center
    build out and memes. </p>
<p>“Real” companies like “carmarkers, airlines, and companies manufacturing household durables such as refrigerators and
    washing machines” have been absolutely hammered under tariffs and economic conditions.</p>

<p><br />As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aefad7d1-e809-4a16-8acd-6e2ef9f28ebe">David Stubbs said</a> “The hope is
    that AI investment will keep the economy going. But you have to acknowledge that some of the tailwinds from greater
    migration and greater fiscal spending have run their course.” </p>
<p>So, if we zoom out, the U.S. economy's broken gearing system is powered by these three separate things: institutional
    speculation on AI, the demographic obligation of healthcare, and the psychological relief of memes. In a healthy
    economy, labor builds the future, but in our economy, labor (as is necessary) maintains the aging population, AI
    speculation builds a future with a 'You’re Not Invited' sign for most people, and memes let us pretend we’re still
    part of it. We have created a world where the only things that grow are this fervent hope that AI works, nursing
    rosters (thankfully), and the hope that your meme coin might moon.</p>
<p>On that trail, Zach was able to fix my bike with his depth of knowledge and care. He essentially bent the derailleur
    back into place. The same thing exists for our economy - the knowledge and care here is incredible. The three
    economies can and must connect. We have the tools. We even have the resources - we're spending trillions on AI
    infrastructure, after all. Memes don’t have to be the only thing we believe in. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading. </p>
