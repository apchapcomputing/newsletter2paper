<![CDATA[ <p>Good morning from the woods!</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a paid subscriber.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Two days ago, I fell off my bike. We were on an incredible trail, perfectly chunky with rocks and just wide enough. I took my eyes off the trail for a second - to ask if everyone else was enjoying the trail as much as I was - and the bike slid out from under me. I was totally okay, but the derailleur, the bike&#8217;s gearing system, was completely bent out of shape. </p><p>So there I was, halfway up a hill, with a bike that could only operate in one gear. I could pedal, but I couldn't shift. I could maybe move forward, but only with tremendous, inefficient effort.</p><p>And to carry a metaphor here - the US economy is sort of like that bike. It's moving, but its gearing system is completely out of whack. The US is operating with 3 broken gears that no longer connect. There are currently 3 Americas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>America 1 (The Speculative Class):</strong> The first America is the speculative class, and its engine is artificial intelligence. The Magnificent 7 are spending over $100 billion a quarter on data centers, which are these monumental projects of hope. They consume vast amounts of capital and electricity, a place where money and power are absorbed in a high-stakes gamble.</p></li><li><p><strong>America 2 (The Real Economy):</strong> The second America is the real economy. With 75% of new jobs in healthcare and social assistance, our workforce is being absorbed by the essential but underfunded &#8216;maintenance economy&#8217; of an aging population. While it props up the labor market, it fails to generate the type of wealth that fuels the stock market or long-term growth, as resources are poured into maintenance rather than creation.</p></li><li><p><strong>America 3 (The Memes):</strong> The third America is the bridge between the other two, acting somewhat as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink">psychological gold sink </a>for those who are priced out of a house and a future. The money spent here is largely speculative and doesn't build a sustainable future (is memecoin investing productive, I don&#8217;t know) but it gives people a sense of agency and hope within a system that otherwise offers them little.</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s a very strange world.</p><h3>America 1: The Speculative Class (AI) </h3><p>Let&#8217;s start with the gear that gets all the attention - the one that's supposed to be powering us into the glorious future, the world of AI. </p><p>AI is weird. <a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/how-ai-conquered-the-us-economy-a">Derek Thompson</a> wrote a nice piece on the good and efficient parts of AI, noting that it&#8217;s making workers more productive (or at least, the workers <em>think</em> so), changing our language (delve), and absorbing a massive amount of cash. But there&#8217;s also the <em>psychological</em> impacts of AI:</p><ul><li><p><strong>People are getting addicted to it</strong> and it could be breaking brains: OpenAI rolled out a new version of the model, changing <a href="https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/">some of its sycophantic tendencies </a>(where it would tell you how smart and beautiful you were, not matter what you said). It was feeding people&#8217;s delusions and causing <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=chat+gpt+psychosis&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">&#8220;Chat-GPT induced psychosis&#8221;</a>! That&#8217;s not a tool that we need during the age of everythingspiracy!</p></li><li><p><strong>It could also making people <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872">stupider</a></strong>, inserting itself between us and the real world, creating a &#8220;technological wedge&#8221; as Ewan Morrison <a href="https://x.com/MrEwanMorrison/status/1949746907238064489">describes</a>, and potentially (?) taking all the jobs (or at least the narrative of jobs) - outside of healthcare, at least. </p></li><li><p><strong>It is impacting both how students learn</strong> (perhaps, making it so they don&#8217;t learn at all) and <strong>the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/business/video/ai-job-market-college-grads-audie-cornish-digvid"> jobs they might get</a></strong> (perhaps, taking their jobs). And interestingly, in the chart below, OpenAI usage drops off around June 6th - around the same time that schools let out. AI is perhaps a school tool above all else.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png" width="673" height="426.23333333333335" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:760,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:673,&quot;bytes&quot;:166713,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/170175290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-L8c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38146d8b-2320-4b3c-b01c-c192e88a8609_1200x760.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1953124372480180550">Google</a> knows this - they are providing Gemini for free for students for a year and investing $1b in AI and career training for every college student in America. </p><p>It&#8217;s just so strange! How we teach students are going to have to change (more written in-classroom essays and a bigger focus on process over outcome) but overall, everyone has more questions than answers right now - is AI the next iteration of the Internet? Is it simply here to give all of us infinite boyfriends and girlfriends? Will it replace the entire employee population at Salesforce? All three? Who knows! But while we're still figuring out if AI is breaking our brains, we're betting the entire economy on it. </p><h4>AI is making things more expensive but it&#8217;s propping up the economy</h4><p>AI takes a lot of power. It&#8217;s putting huge pressure on the consumer, with electricity <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1952756101356650974">costs ticking upwards</a> at the same time that Trump decides there is no need for renewable energy. (Tyler Norris has a good read <a href="https://www.powerpolicy.net/p/data-centers-could-make-or-break">here</a> saying (1) yes the higher electricity costs are data centers and (2) here&#8217;s how we

But there is so far no real wraparound support of finance, trade, and tech transfer&#8212;as no new international order of sustainable governance has yet been built.</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png" width="622" height="479.8285714285714" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1120,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:622,&quot;bytes&quot;:150120,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/170175290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3WFp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9c95ae-784c-4df8-bad9-0bcf5e779cda_1120x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This ties into what Gillian Tett <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/762c79d2-f9c9-4e68-9a9c-bcfd443ad63e">wrote</a> about a few weeks ago - the &#8220;core thesis is that China today has hegemonic control of manufacturing (via its dominance of key supply chain nodes such as rare earth minerals) but the US has hegemonic control of finance (because of the dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status).&#8221; The US still has the dollar, even after all of this. We are still the financial stronghold. But for how much longer?</p><p>As the US is ramping up &#8220;mercantilism and isolationism&#8221; to try and throttle China Tett notes that &#8220;in places such as Asia, cross-border trade is still rising; for many countries globalisation is far from dead&#8221;. Other countries know what works - comparative advantage, free trade, trading with China - and are following that!</p><p>The US seems to developing a data-center driven economy that works for the very few at the expense of many (Noah Smith has an interesting read on the risks of that <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">here</a>). Spend or sink. The problem is, the world might not need another round of software and information technology - and instead it might need the things that <em>power</em> those things like renewable energy and resource efficiency, which China is focused on and the image above shows.</p><p>In the meantime, America 2 grapples with a very different reality.</p><h3>America 2: The Real Economy (Healthcare)</h3><p>The second part of the economy is <strong>healthcare</strong><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>. </p><ul><li><p>75% of the jobs added in July were in <a href="https://x.com/byHeatherLong/status/1951260754411200827">healthcare</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Healthcare, social assistance and state and local government made up almost 70% of the jobs added <a href="https://islg.cuny.edu/blog/human-services-job-growth#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20jobs%20report,mental%20health%20services%2C%20housing%20support.">in the past year. </a></p></li><li><p>Most of the other sectors are shedding jobs (Manufacturing lost <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/economy/us-jobs-report-july">11k </a>jobs in July).</p></li><li><p>Almost <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/daily-dish/an-already-stretched-consumer-threatened-by-weak-job-growth/#:~:text=Continuing%20claims%20remained%20above%20the,annual%20gain%20of%203.8%20percent.">20% of consumers </a>have said it&#8217;s hard to get a job right now, up 5% from January. </p></li><li><p>20% of the US population <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/12/by-2030-all-baby-boomers-will-be-age-65-or-older.html">will be over the age of 65 by 2030</a>, meaning that that the care industry is only going to continue to grow </p></li></ul><p>Healthcare is where the jobs are, but it&#8217;s not where the money goes.

He essentially says that people (who would normally buy a house) are throwing money into financial assets because housing is just too expensive. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png" width="644" height="211.04054054054055" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:388,&quot;width&quot;:1184,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:644,&quot;bytes&quot;:83110,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/170175290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbeJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841ba8a5-fe58-419a-9dd8-ff8e0b0dcc8c_1184x388.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c628bdb-a3f6-47c1-9684-a47410bd4adf">John Burn Murdoch</a> points out that young people are extremely unhappy in the Western world because society broke its promise of a home them -

But you have to acknowledge that some of the tailwinds from greater migration and greater fiscal spending have run their course.&#8221; </p><p>So, if we zoom out, the U.S. economy's broken gearing system is powered by these three separate things: institutional speculation on AI, the demographic obligation of healthcare, and the psychological relief of memes. In a healthy economy, labor builds the future, but in our economy, labor (as is necessary) maintains the aging population, AI speculation builds a future with a 'You&#8217;re Not Invited' sign for most people, and memes let us pretend we&#8217;re still part of it. We have created a world where the only things that grow are this fervent hope that AI works, nursing rosters (thankfully), and the hope that your meme coin might moon.</p><p>On that trail, Zach was able to fix my bike with his depth of knowledge and care. He essentially bent the derailleur back into place. The same thing exists for our economy - the knowledge and care here is incredible. The three economies can and must connect. We have the tools. We even have the resources - we're spending trillions on AI infrastructure, after all. Memes don&#8217;t have to be the only thing we believe in. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

<![CDATA[ <p>Good morning from Aspen, Colorado! </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

This week, I spoke at the Aspen Institute about what it actually feels like for young people trying to live in said economy. Both events were extraordinarily interesting and brought up two main questions: </p><ol><li><p>What is happening to the labor market right now?</p></li><li><p>What do we do about it?</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/gen-z-and-the-end-of-predictable">The path of predictable progress is largely gone</a> - the ROI on a college education is unclear, buying a house (if you don&#8217;t have vast family wealth<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>) feels incredibly out of reach, the rate of getting married and having kids has fallen - combine all that with the push and pull of the transformational power of AI and it makes it all that much more uncertain.</p><p>And of course, that framework is nothing new to anyone at this point. But in this piece, I want to examine the labor market as it actually functions today - less like a ladder, more like a slot machine - and the zero-sum logic that&#8217;s emerged in response.</p><h4>The Rise of Zero-Sum Thinking</h4><p>In 1957, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis">the Soviet launch of Sputnik</a> triggered a huge US response. It led to 3x funding for science education, created NASA and DARPA, and created massive investment in talent and infrastructure (and optimism). The US looked at a challenge and said: <em>We can build our way out of this.</em></p><p>As economist <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/the-sputnik-vs-deepseek-moment-why-the-difference.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> pointed out in his piece about the Sputnik moment, that kind of mobilization didn&#8217;t happen in 2024 when China&#8217;s<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> DeepSeek AI surpassed OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4. The US retreated instead of rallying. We looked at a challenge and say: <em>They must be stealing from us.</em></p><p>This is a shift in how we understand problems and solutions. As Alex highlighted, research shows we're developing what economists call <em>zero-sum thinking</em>, or the belief that my success requires your failure, that wealth and opportunity are fixed pies to be divided rather than expanded. As Alex explains, zero-sum thinkers &#8220;see society as unjust, distrust their fellow citizens and societal institutions, espouse more populist attitudes, and disengage from potentially beneficial interactions.&#8221; It&#8217;s a form of despair that arises during times of economic uncertainty. </p><p>Platforms like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/01/jubilee-media-profile/681411/">Jubilee</a>, where extremists debate for views, have become arenas for this despair. <a href="https://x.com/mehdirhasan/status/1946948641303769495">Mehdi Hasan</a> recently debated 20 Far-Right conservatives in one episode, most of whom argued with emotion over data (as is common on both sides, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/456687-there-is-a-cult-of-ignorance-in-the-united-states">Asimov&#8217;s </a>cult of ignorance in action). It was rage as algorithmic fuel - Imani Barbarin called it the <a href="https://x.com/Imani_Barbarin/status/1947396257066193055">&#8220;memefication of politics&#8221;</a>, which it largely is because it all becomes spectacle. This performative anger is a direct feature of the zero-sum mindset. </p><p>And at scale, this type of mindset can lead to a zero-sum <em>trap</em> as Tabarrok points out </p><blockquote><p>The more people believe that wealth, status, and well-being are zero-sum, the more they back policies that <em>make</em> the world zero-sum.</p></blockquote><p>This is what is going on right now. Putting aside however you might feel about the current administration&#8217;s policies, (1) trade wars (2) deportation quotas and (3) holding pens like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_Alcatraz">&#8220;Alligator Alcatraz&#8221;</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_Alcatraz"> </a>and (4) gutting our science are all extraordinarily zero-sum approaches to building our future, especially when compared to the Sputnik moment of not so long ago. </p><p>The Sputnik generation organized society around creating abundance, a &#8220;creation&#8221; phase of infrastructure. They built universities, highways, suburbs, and systems that expanded opportunity. When they faced the Soviet challenge, they tried to make America richer rather than make the Soviets poorer. There was a belief in a positive-sum future, that everyone could grow together. </p><p>It&#8217;s the reverse now. We are in the &#8220;management&#8221; phase of infrastructure. Rather than viewing immigration as demand expansion and a chance for the pie to grow, we treat it as a scapegoat for wider systemic failures. Immigrants become a proxy war for how we think about identity, who deserves what<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> and people on Jubilee argue over who gets the smaller pie.</p><p>In this management phase, we've watched student loans turn universities into profit centers. We've seen healthcare become a financialized industry. We've witnessed housing become an asset class for investors rather than, you know, homes for people to live in. Everything <em>feels</em> like it's being optimized for someone else's profit rather than expanded for everyone's benefit. And so young people (and everyone else living through this moment) have been taught to think in zero-sum redistribution rather than positive-sum creation. </p><p>Can we reverse it? How can we build a Sputnik moment again? It begins by tackling the very real challenges in our labor market.</p><h4>The Labor Force</h4><p>There are two important themes to understand about the labor market right now, as documented by <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/labor-market-analysis/dont-blame-ai-for-the-rise-in-recent-graduate-unemployment/">Will Raderman </a>in a guest post for EmployAmerica and<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a9eadb06-8085-4661-9713-846ebe128131"> John Burn Murdoch of the FT</a>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>College graduates are struggling.</strong> &#8220;Since 2018, the unemployment rate of recent college graduates has generally been higher than the rest of the labor force.&#8221; - Will </p></li><li><p><strong>Young men are struggling the most.</strong> &#8220;The rise in graduate joblessness is concentrated almost entirely among young American men.&#8221; - John</p></li></ol><p>Both John and Will are quick to point out that the rise joblessness isn&#8217;t due to AI but rather </p><ol><li><p>Sectoral changes, like the shift to a healthcare-oriented jobs which tend to be dominated by women</p></li><li><p>Supply and demand - there are a lot more college grads than there used to be</p></li><li><p>A softening of the overall labor market in our current slow-to-hire, slow-to-fire environment<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> and </p></li><li><p>The techcession of the past few years, with higher rates striking reality into the heart of many of a vaporware company. </p></li></ol><p>So, to repeat, recent college graduates now have higher unemployment rates than the overall workforce. This isn't supposed to happen. For decades, a degree was economic insurance - graduates always found work faster than everyone else. That&#8217;s what you pay for. </p><h4>Is College Worth It?</h4><p>But we're asking the wrong question entirely about college. Instead of 'Is college worth it?' we should be asking 'Which parts of college are working, and what does that tell us about the future?'</p><p>The math is brutal for most graduates. Boomers could trade 4 years of college for 40 years of middle-class security (more or less). Today's 25-year-old faces a negative net-present-value on that same deal.

As John reports, &#8220;almost 50,000 of the 135,000 additional jobs filled by young women graduates in the past year were in America&#8217;s healthcare sector &#8212; more than double the total number of additional jobs going to graduate men across all sectors over the same period.&#8221; This is partly because by 2030, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/11/1-in-5-americans-to-be-65-years-old-or-older-by-2030-86270288">1 in 5 adults in the US will be over the age of 65 </a>and partly because we are a rather sick and unhealthy country. </p></li><li><p><strong>Men are not:</strong> One solution floated to help men out is to bring manufacturing jobs back, a revival of the 1990s. The problem is that there are <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/15/americans-want-factory-jobs-reshored-dont-want-work-them/">500,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs open right now,</a> so maybe we should focus on filling those with proper investment in training, rather than <a href="https://x.com/ENERGY/status/1946570851974832544">mining coal again</a>. </p></li></ul><p>These shifts underscore a fundamental truth: the economy has changed, jobs have changed. Jobs have changed. Colleges have to change. Training has to change. This is about aligning our education system with the actual structure of today&#8217;s economy. A real Sputnik moment wouldn&#8217;t just yell <em>bring the jobs back!</em> It would ask: <em>what kind of future are we preparing people for?</em></p><h4>The Hiring Process </h4><p>And this is about <em>how</em> people get hired too, not just the jobs themselves. </p><p><a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/young-people-face-a-hiring-crisis">Derek Thompson </a>also wrote about this phenomenon a few weeks ago, noting that AI has essentially turned job applications into an arms race. Humans send thousands of tailored AI-generated resumes at job postings, <a href="https://x.com/ObviousRises/status/1947769725184098565">companies deploy bots to screen them creating total vacuum of bots talking to</a> each other (similar to how bots are enjoying the AI generated music on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-ai-music-robot-listeners/">Spotify</a>). It turns it into a numbers game. </p><p>Back in 2019, I applied to over 150 jobs when I graduated Western Kentucky University. LinkedIn had their little QuickApply feature, but I wrote so many essays, did many projects, and endless interviews. The entire process made me better, but I was rejected from most of the jobs. </p><p>I had a 4.0 GPA, was valedictorian with three majors, worked three jobs for most of my time at university, sold cars, ran D1 Track and Field for a year, and yet, I only got into my first job because the recruiter and some people at the company took a big chance on me (and I only got there because they had a blind resume process where they hid the school. Says a lot about a lot). </p><p>The only reason I got my chance - a truly lucky break - was because <em>people</em> bet on me. A computer would have instantly rejected me because I didn&#8217;t meet some arbitrary qualification. AI has spurred us right into the depths of what David Brooks calls <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/opinion/rejection-college-youth.html">the rejected generation</a> - endless nos from platforms that are meant to serve as human interfaces (slot machine grabs across dating, investing, and now jobs), but really end up dehumanizing the whole process. </p><p>This is why young people are applying to 1,000 jobs - (1) to get one and (2) they're desperately seeking algorithmic validation to replace the human validation that the system has removed. The job search used to be a proving ground of sorts. The job search becoming algorithmic removes the human validation that made rejection bearable. When a human rejects you, you can tell yourself they didn't "get" you. When an algorithm rejects you, it feels like objective proof that you're insufficient. No wonder they're developing zero-sum mindsets and political radicalization.</p><p>This game fosters a dangerous proficiency illusion too, where both applicants (through AI-generated resumes designed to 'beat the bot') and companies (through AI screening that prioritizes keywords over skill) are optimizing for algorithmic compatibility rather than genuine human capability. It&#8217;s a performative dance for the machine, potentially eroding the very skills critical thinking and problem-solving needed for future human capital.</p><h4>The Casino Economy</h4><p>This is the casino economy in action. Again, just like dating apps and meme stock trading, the job market has created the illusion of abundance by replacing meaningful friction with meaningless volume. It has become a dopamonster, to borrow Scott Galloway&#8217;s word. More applications, more swipes, more trades - but every extra option raises the noise-to-signal ratio, making the median outcome worse for everyone.</p><p>A job market that once rewarded persistence now punishes it. A dating market that once rewarded genuine connection now atomizes it. Markets that once rewarded research and patience (sort of) now gamifies everything into day-trading dopamine hits. When the only lever left is 'push more buttons,' the rational response becomes zero-sum cynicism.</p><p>We've turned job hunting into a lottery where you buy as many tickets as possible and pray one hits and it is destroying our belief in meritocracy itself. When getting a job feels like winning the lottery<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>, what happens to the 'hard work pays off' narrative that held American society together? It creates the kind of thinking that feeds zero-sum thinking: &#8220;if I can only win by gaming a rigged system, then the system itself must be fundamentally unjust.&#8221;</p><p>In a true market, skill creates value. The casino economy is about simulated fairness masking an imbalance. Everyone feels like they <em>could</em> win - and this structure thrives on hope just long enough to drain it.</p><h4>What Next?</h4><p>The zero-sum trap is reinforced by institutions that feel broken, bogged down by the "management phase" of infrastructure where inertia takes over innovation. Systems that work are what make belief possible again.</p><h4>Reclaiming Capacity </h4><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/opinion/trump-budget-state-city-local.html">Robert Gordon and Jennifer Pahlka</a> wrote in The New York Times, a new playbook is emerging in &#8220;intelligent disruption&#8221;, and they highlight cities that are making sure &#8220;that our public institutions have the right people doing the right work&#8221; rather than &#8220;across-the-board cuts to programs and raise fees and maybe taxes&#8221;. </p><p>In Denver, Mayor Mike Johnston got rid of antiquated seniority-based layoff rules, instead empowering managers to weigh performance and ability. It&#8217;s never good when anyone gets laid off. But instead of the typical last to hire, first to fire, this playbook is focused on ensuring the public has the <em>right people doing the right work</em>, rather than simply preserving obsolete positions. </p><p>San Francisco's City Attorney, David Chiu, used AI to identify over 500 outdated requirements for staff reports (the thing that leads to public toilets costing $1.7 million.) The goal is to eliminate excessive regulation. Another thing that Pahlka and Gordon focus on is using technology smartly - New Jersey has trained their employees to use AI, rather than banning it entirely. </p><h4>Redefining Prosperity</h4><p>Another piece offered some food for thought (and threads of hope). <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/opinion/democrats-politics-trump-abundance.html">Jonathan Rauch and Peter Wehner</a> wrote on how to rewire this infrastructure of opportunity, addressing young people&#8217;s economic concerns, interviewing 19 democrats across a range of views. The main takeaway I got from their article is that Democrats need to (1) build more (2) talk normal (move past the memefication of politics and focus even more on shared, tangible realities and problems) (3) put forward proposals like building vocational-technical high schools and chartering new cities. </p><p>Affordability is the #1 issue. </p><p>Many young people supported Trump in the election because they believed he would protect the economy. It&#8217;s also why Mamdani won. Faced with rising inflation, a broken labor market, and deep frustration over student debt and housing costs, Trump&#8217;s narrative offered clarity: he promised lower prices, more jobs, and a return to order. </p><p>But by July, that promise has largely unraveled. His tariffs have backfired, shouldered by the consumer, raising the cost of goods like clothes and electronics, as th<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-price-hikes-essentials-60a7c7f3?mod=livecoverage_web">e WSJ documents in their piece on Amazon hiking prices</a> on most essential goods by 5% over the past 4 months.</p><p>For a generation that experiences policy in real time through TikToks about layoffs, evictions, and AI ghosting, the disconnect was immediate. His approval rating among those aged 18-29 has fallen by 44 points, <a href="https://x.com/IAPolls2022/status/1947397923999830321">with 72% disapproving. </a>I am not sure if they will flip back. People voted for him to make things real again<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a>, and instead he&#8217;s very much added to the fog rather than lifting it. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg" width="1080" height="463" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:463,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:71677,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/168954148?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xbcw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744af90f-128d-4e39-85ea-405a50a753c9_1080x463.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Some people seem to think that<a href="https://x.com/HarrisonHSmith/status/1947774051113464264"> young people went further right</a> - that &#8220;Trump isn&#8217;t conservative enough&#8221;.

She spent the entire six hour flight scrolling through TikTok. It was strange to watch - I was watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Day">Training Day </a>and I'd glance over to see her consuming an endless stream of get-ready-with-me videos, a new thing every 3 minutes, a jump from one filtered person to another, each competing for the same scarce resource: her attention. She wasn't consuming content so much as being consumed by it.</p><p>Everything feels like that now? We're living in this constant scroll, trying to make sense of the world around us within a world confined by the limitations of an algorithm that doesn't care about truth, coherence, or consequences, only engagement.</p><p>And logically, this also became how we govern.</p><p>The Trump Administration has taken full advantage of this algorithm brain. We&#8217;ve entered the pure extraction phase of the economy, where things are created solely for consumption rather than purpose. I don&#8217;t mean this as a moralistic argument, it&#8217;s purely incentives, but it&#8217;s puzzling. </p><p>Take the picture below. This is a fan account for <a href="https://x.com/defense_civil25/status/1941543955381764111">the Department of Homeland Security</a> tweeting about the 2026 White House x UFC Fight Night. It&#8217;s a perfect image of the present moment. This is most powerful building in the world, a representation of freedom, lit up during an ominous storm, the flag drooping above, crowds gathered around a UFC-branded octagon - it&#8217;s creepy AI fever dream, but it&#8217;s very, very real. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

What do we do next?</p><p>In Part 1 of this series, <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/trump-mamdani-and-cluely">Trump, Mamdani, and Cluely</a>, I mapped how attention became infrastructure, narrative became capital, and speculation became the operating system between them. </p><p>Here in Part 2, we will hopefully answer some more questions and provide some more solutions. </p><ul><li><p>What happens when an entire civilization optimizes for extraction over creation? </p></li><li><p>What are the material consequences when your resource allocation system rewards virality over productive capacity? </p></li></ul><p>China is building the infrastructure for 21st-century economic dominance. As we're financializing everything, they're electrifying everything. We're optimizing for attention while they're optimizing for capacity. We must figure out how to channel the dynamics of the attention economy toward <em>creation</em> rather than <em>extraction</em>.</p><p>So&#8230; how?</p><h3>Act 2: The Dollar, Energy, and Trust </h3><h4>The Big Beautiful Bill </h4><p>Somewhere along the way, the United States decided that the most sophisticated thing you could do with economic power was to financialize it and to create increasingly complex mechanisms for extracting value from existing systems rather than building new ones. </p><p>We took the incredible wealth-generating capacity that built America and the industrial logic that made us globally dominant and we turned it into a machine for redistributing wealth from the future to the present, from the young to the old, much funneling to the already-wealthy. </p><p>This is the governing philosophy of extraction. Take the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/07/why-big-beautiful-bill-doesnt-end-taxes-on-social-security-benefits.html"> Big Beautiful Bill </a>that just passed. We're adding $4.1 trillion to the national debt <a href="https://x.com/DavidBeckworth/status/1940848210487947429">(potentially $5.5 trillion) </a>to fund tax cuts. We are funding it (or at least, some of it) by cutting billions from SNAP, stripping healthcare from millions of Americans, and slashing the National Science Foundation budget.</p><p>The BBB very clearly establishes that more money will go toward <em>extraction</em> versus <em>creation</em>. We will not beat China with tax cuts! And rather than building systems that create new wealth, we're building systems that redistribute existing wealth to those who already have the most political power. </p><p>It's completely economically incoherent and politically brilliant, which tells you everything you need to know about how our resource allocation system actually works. Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/politics/murkowski-republican-bill.html">Lisa Murkowski</a>, who was the deciding vote, captured this approach perfectly when she said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska&#8217;s interests. But I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And that&#8217;s the conundrum of an extractive economy. Everyone protects what they have instead of incentivizing what they could make. </p><h4>The Dollar </h4><p>We're also extracting value from America's position in the global financial system without rebuilding the foundations that created that position in the first place. Karthik&#8217;s piece on <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/monetizing-primacy/">Monetizing Primacy</a> is a great read on the complicated relationship the Trump administration has with the dollar. </p><p>He writes about the stablecoin legislation that passed through the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/394/text">the GENIUS Act</a>. It&#8217;s a pretty distilled version of extraction. The theory, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is that stablecoins will create massive new demand for US Treasuries, maybe $3.7 trillion worth over the next few years, which is substantial! Sure!</p><ul><li><p>Foreign capital will buy these digital dollars</p></li><li><p>Stablecoin issuers will pocket the yield</p></li><li><p>And Treasury gets a new source of funding!</p></li></ul><p>Stablecoins take advantage of an existing system<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>, rather than building upon it. And the dollar is very valuable to the United States. The problem is the Trump administration doesn&#8217;t know what it wants from the dollar. It both wants a <strong>weak dollar</strong> to encourage reindustrialization and a <strong>strong dollar</strong> to prevent inflationary fallout from tariffs. And the dollar, as Karthik explains, is valued by </p><ul><li><p>Fiscal and mon&#173;et&#173;ary policy inter&#173;ac&#173;tions</p></li><li><p>The polit&#173;ics of cent&#173;ral bank&#173;ing</p></li><li><p>Expect&#173;a&#173;tions of the rate of return on Amer&#173;ican assets.</p></li></ul><p>So when you take that equation:</p><ul><li><p>Fiscal policy via blowing out the deficit with the BBB</p></li><li><p>Monetary policy which is frozen because of the tariffs we can&#8217;t get an answer on</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration actively threatening Jerome Powell</p></li></ul><p>You get a weak dollar. And you get higher bond yields because everyone is like &#8220;um, hello?&#8221; That combination is a crisis-of-confidence signal. </p><p>If the trust in the dollar begins to erode and if other countries begin to believe the dollar is being governed by a reality TV feedback loop then the whole system begins to shift. </p><p>That will weaken the dollar too. A weaker dollar raises the cost of living, shrinks geopolitical leverage, and chips away at the safety net while making it harder for people to understand why things suddenly feel worse.</p><p>So to the point of stablecoins - it's a classic attention-speculation play to create a new financial instrument that generates engagement while (maybe) theoretically serving strategic goals. But the underlying mechanism is fundamentally <em>extractive</em> rather than <em>productive</em>. </p><p>Extraction only works for so long. Eventually, you have to create again. </p><h4>Energy</h4><p>And this creation begins with energy! At the exact moment when AI is creating unprecedented demand for electricity (and is the backbone of the entire S&amp;P 500), America is dismantling its capacity to generate power through some of the cheapest, fastest-to-deploy sources available through the Big Beautiful Bill. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/opinion/trump-bill-clean-energy-china.html">Thomas Friedman wrote: </a></p><blockquote><p>There has never been a more intimate connection between the amount of cheap, clean electricity a nation can generate for A.I. models and its future economic and military might.</p></blockquote><p>The bill ignores all of that and instead prioritizes the past over the future:</p><ul><li><p>Phases out clean electricity tax credits for wind and solar</p></li><li><p>Adds complex restrictions to battery storage credits</p></li><li><p>Bans fees on methane emissions</p></li><li><p>Opens up federal lands and waters to oil and gas drilling</p></li><li><p>Orders 4 million additional acres of federal land be made available for coal mining</p></li></ul><p>All because clean energy is coded as lib or is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/07/03/beautiful-coal-ugly-solar-wind/">aesthetically unpleasing</a> or something. It completely misunderstands where energy comes from - 93% (!) of the electricity capacity added to the grid in 2025 will come from wind, solar, and battery storage as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/congress-electricity-tax-cuts/683416/">Rog&#233; Karma writes in the Atlantic.</a> Texas was the top solar state in the nation, adding 10,000 megawatts of power in the last year, mostly from solar-plus-batteries, and saw brownouts decrease as a result.</p><p>But rather than scaling this success nationally, we're making it more expensive going forward. Energy Innovation projects that Trump's bill will increase wholesale electricity prices by roughly 50% by 2035, with cumulative consumer energy costs rising more than $16 billion by 2030. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/congress-electricity-tax-cuts/683416/">Some 830,000 renewable energy jobs will be lost or not created.</a> We are weakening our competitive position to play tribalism games in the name of the attention economy. </p><h3>Act III: The Alternative</h3><h4>China vs the United States</h4><p>And this is where the China comparison comes in. China, for all its (very many) faults, spends its money on itself. It builds infrastructure. It trains engineers. It electrifies villages. It rewards capacity. </p><p>By contrast, the US has the <a href="https://x.com/fredsoda/status/1941879474129186934">infinite money glitch</a> as <a href="https://x.com/fredsoda/status/1941879474129186934">Soda</a> said (the dollar) and we&#8217;ve used this vast financial and worldwide power mostly to subsidize stock buybacks (which certainly has generated value in its own way) but that differentiation is the key line between the US and China. Value is understood and developed differently between the two countries. </p><ul><li><p>Because of deindustrialization, the US has lost coordination capacity. </p></li><li><p>And the world has changed since. We have a murky idea of what we are supposed to be building - maybe it&#8217;s a generative AI slop machine, maybe it&#8217;s the future of manufacturing, I guess the free market will decide. </p></li></ul><p>But China has made the <em>conscious</em> decision to invest in people, knowledge, and systems like their <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-high-speed-rail-next-generation-2085191?utm_source=chatgpt.com">next-generation high-speed train, the CR450</a> which will allow for the country to be connected even more - and encourage even more innovation. </p><p>They treat human capital as infrastructure, the same way we treat attention as infrastructure. David Autor, an MIT economist, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/07/1119658/the-latest-threat-from-the-rise-of-chinese-manufacturing/">did an incredible interview </a>on the US-China race in manufacturing. The whole interview is worth a listen (essentially, the days of yesteryear aren&#8217;t coming back) and the problem we face is extraordinarily serious. It will take public knowledge to address and public money to address:</p><blockquote><p>We&#8217;re in the midst of a totally different competition with China now that&#8217;s much, much more important. Now we&#8217;re not talking about commodity furniture and tube socks. We&#8217;re talking about semiconductors and drones and aviation, electric vehicles, shipping, fusion power, quantum, AI, robotics. These are the sectors where the US still maintains competitiveness, but they&#8217;re extremely threatened. China&#8217;s capacity for high-tech, low-cost, incredibly fast, innovative manufacturing is just unbelievable. <strong>And the Trump administration is basically fighting the war of 20 years ago.</strong> The loss of those jobs, you know, was devastating to those places. It was not devastating to the US economy as a whole. If we lose Boeing, GM, and Apple and Intel&#8212;and that&#8217;s quite possible&#8212;then that will be economically devastating.</p></blockquote><p>China understands<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> something that American policymakers seem to have forgotten: there has never been a clearer connection between a (1) nation's ability to generate huge amounts of electricity at affordable prices and (2) its ability to develop the AI systems that could determine future economic and military advantage.</p><p>As Autor said, the Trump administration is fighting the war of 20 years ago. We are memeing our way through a time of vast geopolitical change<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>, passing cuts to science and energy and <a href="https://www.ipm.org/news-section/2025-06-30/indiana-public-colleges-cut-almost-20-of-degrees">cutting degree offerings</a> all of which will likely kneecap our role in the world, and are for some reason presuming that stablecoins are going to save us<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>. </p><p>As Lu Feng said:</p><blockquote><p>The past 500 years of world history show that an industrial power has never lost when challenged by a financial power, even when the financial power is also a global hegemon. </p></blockquote><h4>Antimemes</h4><p>We all know that the attention economy erodes trust. It rewards the most dramatic claims, the most outrageous behavior, the most compelling narratives regardless of their relationship to truth or long-term consequences. </p><p>As Ezra and I discussed, it creates adverse selection: the people most willing to play by attention economy rules are often the least suitable for positions requiring patient stewardship of complex systems and the feedback loops are accelerating. </p><ul><li><p>As traditional institutions lose credibility, more activity shifts to attention-based platforms. </p></li><li><p>As more activity shifts to attention-based platforms, the incentives become more distorted.</p></li><li><p>As the incentives become more distorted, traditional institutions lose more credibility.</p></li></ul><p>We're not just losing to China because <em>they're</em> good at what they do. We're losing because our own systems are increasingly optimized for outcomes that make us less competitive. You can't run an industrial economy on spectacle! You can't compete with China using tax cuts! You can't maintain global worldwide power through financial engineering if you're dismantling the productive capacity that makes you globally competitive in the first place!!</p><p><a href="https://nayafia.substack.com/p/introducing-antimemetics-my-new-book">Nadia Asparouhova's book about antimemetics</a> helps explain why we're stuck in these destructive loops. Antimemes are high-impact, low-transmissibility ideas. Compared to traditional memes, they are hard to spread because they're complex, counterintuitive, or culturally taboo. </p><p>The attention economy is hostile to antimeme development. It rewards ideas that spread quickly and generate immediate engagement, not ideas that require patient development over years or decades. Supermemes - those apocalyptic, high-transmissibility ideas like "AI will kill us all" or "climate change will end civilization" suck up all the cognitive bandwidth while the important work of building alternative systems happens in the shadows.</p><p>The result is a political discourse dominated by supermemes that generate lots of engagement but very little constructive action, while the antimemes that might actually solve our problems like &#8220;how to build industrial policy that works&#8221; or &#8220;how to design monetary systems for multipolarity&#8221; remain confined to small networks of specialists.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png" width="1166" height="470" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:470,&quot;width&quot;:1166,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:101685,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/167101876?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfVE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa00a89a2-570c-4f6f-b5b7-21fe596530ee_1166x470.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We're trapped in the &#8220;infinite AI TikTok slop machine&#8221; - an information environment that makes long-term strategic thinking nearly impossible while rewarding the kind of attention-seeking behavior that undermines our competitive position. We need more infrastructure around real ideas. </p><h4>Act IV: The Way Out </h4><p>The way out requires acknowledging that the attention economy's incentive structure is quite misaligned with the requirements of maintaining complex civilizations. </p><p>So what can we do?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reintroduce friction:</strong> We&#8217;ve mistaken convenience for progress. Instead of making everything easier, we need to make important things appropriately difficult in the digtital world. Right now, the system rewards the performance of expertise rather than its development. AI makes that worse. We likely will have to rethink education - AI will be a part of it, and right now, the system rewards output over understanding, so of course students are Chat-GPTing essays. Some things will have to be harder than they currently are - maybe getting a college degree should require more than the ability to prompt an AI effectively. (maybe governing a country should require more than generating attention on social media.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Treating attention as infrastructure rather than a market to be optimized.</strong> Right now, we treat attention like a commodity. It&#8217;s something to be mined, optimized, and sold to the highest bidder. But attention is infrastructure! It&#8217;s the invisible highway that ideas, identities, and institutions travel on. We have to invest in it like we would a highway. We&#8217;ve built a digital ecosystem that optimizes for engagement, not understanding. As boring as it is, we need new algorithms and to treat attention as a shared utility. </p></li><li><p><strong>Boring things.</strong> Most of the ideas that will save us are boring at first. We need to rewire our entire grid, retrain an industrial workforce, and build factories We need more of the Manhattan Project, the Interstate Highway System, DARPA, etc - the confluence of public investment (and probably private investment at this point) and educational training systems that directly train people for the phenomenal task of rebuilding the physical infrastructure of the United States. </p></li><li><p><strong>Rebuild systems that restore stakes. </strong>A functioning economic and political system doesn&#8217;t need to give everyone the same outcome, but it must give them a stake in the game. Today, vast swaths of the public don&#8217;t see policy as cause-and-effect. They see it as a performance, a branding exercise, a series of decisions made for someone else. That&#8217;s why <a href="https://x.com/scarylawyerguy/status/1942199823723053432">Kansas farmers vote for a leader </a>who guts their food export program. And it&#8217;s why young people identify as socialists- what&#8217;s the alternative? As Peter Thiel once noted: people without a stake in capitalism will rationally turn against it. What we're seeing now is that process playing out. Reestablishing stakes doesn&#8217;t mean giving everyone money in the S&amp;P or whatever. It means showing them that effort leads to change and that policy is cause-and-effect. </p></li></ol><p>One thing that I tried to get across in the Ezra interview (and he kindly asked me a followup so I could be clearer about it) was that there are two worlds right now, the digital world and the physical world. Floods just wreaked havoc on Texas, and <a href="https://x.com/GMA/status/1942185536304676874">Coast</a> <a href="https://x.com/GMA/status/1942185536304676874">Guard Rescue swimmer Scott Ruskin </a>rescued 165 people from the raging waters. </p><p>As<a href="https://x.com/KeenanPeachy/status/1942267424520425801"> Peachy Keenan </a>said, the job Scott did has a few requirements - you must (1) love your country enough to be willing to put yourself in harm's way for it and (2) love your fellow citizens enough to risk your life for them. </p><p>That has nothing to do with the attention economy and everything to do with what it means to be a human. Its creation in its purest form - creating safety, trust, and meaning through competence and service. As C.S. Lewis said: </p><blockquote><p>Since it is so likely that children will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage </p></blockquote><p>Many of the things we fund right now are completely killing us. </p><p>We need strategic investments in creation over extraction while acknowledging that the attention economy is a part of that. But it doesn't have to be the dominant logic of resource allocation. It doesn&#8217;t need to be so extractive. </p><p>Every day, people are making the other choice to create. They're installing solar panels and rescuing flood victims and teaching skills and building the infrastructure that keeps civilization running. They're choosing the hard work of creation over the easy work of extraction. We have all the pieces, we just have to realign our capabilities and our priorities. </p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

I was in the middle of the grocery store grabbing bananas when I got the notification, which just underscored how strange and disorienting this all is. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg" width="592" height="287" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:287,&quot;width&quot;:592,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:62680,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/166662346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1OT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422c8cd9-2332-47bd-93ae-3370937c1c85_592x287.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary</a>, a highly contested race that he ran with sheer narrative discipline and command of the digital. Even if you don&#8217;t like his policies (I think many of them are unworkable) the campaign was good! He walked the entire length of Manhattan. He was everywhere, all the time.</p><p>And finally, a few days before both of those, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-21/andreessen-horowitz-backs-ai-startup-with-slogan-cheat-at-everything">a startup called Cluely<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </a>raised a $15 million round led by a16z<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. The company&#8217;s modus operandi is <a href="https://x.com/FT/status/1937518626484912447">&#8216;cheat on everything&#8217;. </a>Like sure, of course. But a16z didn&#8217;t invest based on that! They invested based on Cluely&#8217;s attention capture capability! Cluely is good at getting people to pay attention to them and is largely copying the enterprise Jake Paul playbook (stunts, virality, nihilism, and a vibe-first narrative) for B2C AI apps. We&#8217;ve already seen &#8220;brain-rot marketing&#8221; take over culture so it was only a matter of time before it hit the startup world.</p><p>But these three things - geopolitical conflict, a mayoral primary, a startup raise - are indicators of something I want to tie a thread through in this piece:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attention is infrastructure</strong>: Determines what gets funded, elected, or build</p></li><li><p><strong>Narrative is capital</strong>: It drives flows of money, policy, and sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speculation</strong> is the <strong>operating layer</strong> between the two - it&#8217;s how belief is tested, priced, and converted into outcomes <em>before</em> institutions act.</p></li></ul><p>What we&#8217;re seeing isn&#8217;t just a media trend. It&#8217;s a shift in the architecture of power. Attention &#8594; Speculation &#8594; Allocation. This is the new supply chain.</p><p>Traditional economic theory assumes information flows serve resource allocation. But increasingly, resource allocation serves attention flows. We've moved from an economy where attention supports other forms of value creation to one where attention <em>is</em> the value creation. </p><h4>How to Think About Attention</h4><p>Traditional economic substrates are land, labor, capital - bedrock inputs to make stuff. But now, the foundational input is attention. </p><p>Trump said he was going to take 2 weeks or so to think it through the Iran bombings&#8230; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/politics/trump-truth-social-iran-war.html">then just did it?</a> The NYT later reported that the decision to strike was influenced in part by how the Israeli campaign was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html"> &#8220;playing&#8221; on Fox News</a>, so Trump&#8217;s response very much felt like a reactive spectacle<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> rather than military strategy. And it played like theater!</p><ul><li><p>Iran knew Trump might do something because of his<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html"> incessant posts.</a></p></li><li><p>Military officials feared that Trump&#8217;s posts were compromising operational secrecy, so they ordered a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/maga-movement-divided-trump-iran">diversionary B-2 flight to distract from the real mission. </a></p></li><li><p>Iran simply moved their uranium to a different spot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/iran-uranium-stockpile-whereabouts.html">and now we don&#8217;t seem to know where it is. </a></p></li><li><p>It seems like the bombs<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/22/nx-s1-5441734/satellites-show-damage-iran-nuclear-program-not-destroyed-experts-say"> didn&#8217;t really hit what they were supposed to?</a></p></li><li><p>Iran retaliated a few days later by<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/iran-missile-strike-on-qatar-base-fits-de-escalation-playbook?taid=6859a79c8217380001324705&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"> striking US Gulf bases </a>signaling to the US ahead of time that the bases would be hit (I was also in the grocery store when I found out about this one)</p></li><li><p>The fact that they didn&#8217;t close down the Strait of Hormuz is a sign that things might (?) be petering out from here (I write tentatively on the morning of June 25). </p></li><li><p>Trump called for a ceasefire, a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/24/world/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump">nd both Israel and Iran seem to be ignoring him</a></p></li><li><p>He said China can continue buying Iranian oil, apparently<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil"> lifting the sanctions?</a></p></li><li><p>He got <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1937468807536169315">very mad</a> (understandably) on Live TV </p></li></ul><p>Trump only notified <em>Republican</em> members of Congress about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-both-parties-question-legality-trumps-iran-strikes-rcna214316">strikes</a>, which isn&#8217;t great. It also seems that intelligence briefings said that Iran <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia">wasn&#8217;t</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia"> actively weaponizing its nuclear program</a> (making the bombing illegal). But, when Congress is as useful as a fish flopping next to a giant body of water, the law matters less than content strategy. </p><p>Trump yet again inverted system architecture - flipping how information and decision-making traditionally flow. Military strategy and diplomacy all became subordinate to social media dynamics. But he is moving on as <a href="https://x.com/David_Rudnick/status/1937471865490145711">if war is only a weekend thing</a>. As his State Department spokeswoman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of the president or try to guess what his strategy will be. Things happen quickly and I think we&#8217;ll find out sooner than later.</p></blockquote><p>And this gets into the tricky part of the attention economy - it&#8217;s easy to get eyeballs, sure, and people will do wilder and wilder stunts to keep eyes on them. But what happens when people stop paying attention? Here, it&#8217;s that Iran will likely continue pursuing a nuclear bomb because all they have to do to understand the narrative is watch the feed, and that holds heavy, heavy consequences. </p><h4>Zohran Mamdani</h4><p>There are many great essays on Mamdani (<a href="https://derekthompson.substack.com/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance">Derek Thompson just joined Substack!</a>), so I won&#8217;t belabor it too much here. But yesterday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primar</a>y. A 33-year-old democratic socialist just beat a former governor - Andrew Cuomo - by running a campaign that got a lot of attention. 4.5 months ago<a href="https://x.com/hecubian_devil/status/1937696976315039778"> he was polling at 1%! </a></p><p>Most of his messaging was about <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1878853557111414795">affordability</a> (which is also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-climate-change-immigration-tariffs-young-voters-e4bd29e491d42fd989c32be8eeb2a2cb">why Trump won among young voters</a>). He is a master of short-form video and podcasts, but he was also <em>physically</em> in NYC, again, walking the length of the city. Cuomo was advertising on TV and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-campaign-finance.html">raised $25 million in the largest super PAC ever created in a NYC mayoral campaign</a> (!) but that simply didn&#8217;t matter</p><p>And as many have said, Mamdani is the most Trump-like candidate *in messaging* the left has produced - he had a deeply online campaign, he did every interview he could, he has a loyal base <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1937339211004154269">(they knocked on 1.5 million doors!</a>), and clear messaging. </p><p>Mamdani proved attention is the path to institutional override. Just like Trump, but from the other side.</p><p>The shift isn&#8217;t that surprising, and it will happen more now, on both ends. People are largely frustrated with the status quo. There is excitement in rule bending, like JD Vance <a href="https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1937684913278370161">sticking up a middle finger</a> or Trump dropping an F-bomb on C-Span. </p><p>The ideas matter, sure. People voted for Trump because <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-campaign-promise-tracker/">they wanted deportations and unwokeness </a>but also because he was different and new. Mamdani promises affordability and fresh new ideas. It feels like change in a world where people are not listened to.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> </p><h4>How They All Tie Together</h4><p>All three stories - Trump bombing Iran on social, Mamdani walking Manhattan on TikTok, Cluely&#8217;s raise - have one thing in common: the power came from attention, and attention came from narrative discipline. </p><p>It operates like a supply chain of sorts:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

When a16z funds Cluely based purely on attention capture capability, they're legitimizing attention as a fundable asset class. That sends a signal to every other founder - build for virality, not just utility. It&#8217;s American Dynamism!</p><p>Attention is the raw material of economic, political, and military action. But speculation is what operationalizes that attention: the bets people place (emotionally, politically, financially) on what narrative will become real. </p><p>And in politics, this type of speculation has become the closest thing to agency for people who feel like they are no longer served by the economy. People speculate on ideas, personalities, etc. Why wouldn&#8217;t they? But when this happens, you end up with a system optimized for speed and virality rather than stability or accuracy.</p><p>And I think that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s an informal coalition that controls resource allocation now - podcasters like Joe Rogan, YouTubers like Mr Beast, guys like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk, who has not said one word about what's going on, is a narrative thermostat. They are masters of speed and virality. </p><p>They all take that speculation, determine what gets attention, which increasingly determines what gets resources. The world is learning from them now - startups, politicians, geopolitical strategy. The "checks and balances" no longer come from Congress or the courts, but from the feed. </p><h4>We&#8217;ve Been Here Before</h4><p>What I'm describing isn't entirely unprecedented, of course. Many have discussed<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>. Back in 1971, Herbert Simon wrote in <a href="https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/2005/DESIGNING%2BORGANIZATIONS%2Bfor%2BInformation-Rich%2Bworld%2B--%2BSImon.pdf">Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</p></blockquote><p>Information abundance creates attention scarcity! By 1997 (!) Michael Goldhaber was pushed this further with <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/519/440">The Attention Economy and the Net </a>arguing that attention was becoming the new currency of the digital age. </p><blockquote><p>The attention economy brings with it its own kind of wealth, its own class divisions - stars vs. fans - and its own forms of property, all of which make it incompatible with the industrial-money-market based economy it bids fair to replace. Success will come to those who best accommodate to this new reality.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Shiller coined <em>narrative economics,</em> arguing that stories drive economic behavior. I think we are in a new iteration of all of this where the stories aren't just influencing economic activity, they <em>are</em> the economic activity. Attention is a precursor to wealth (in many ways) and speculation drives it. </p><p>Succinctly&#8230; everything feels like crypto now? Crypto doesn&#8217;t represent &#8220;real&#8221; value (some things in the industry do, but broad brushstrokes), but it synthesizes it through speculation and belief. Vibes, volatility, and mindshare, if you will. We're now living in a system where attention dynamics are the operating system for resource allocation, political decisions, and identity formation. </p><h4>What Comes Next</h4><p>This intersection of speculation and attention feels ignored outside of markets. And the question isn't whether we can build better housing or infrastructure - though we desperately need both. The question is whether we can build anything coherent when the resource allocation system rewards attention over everything else. </p><p>Because right now, the person who can generate the most compelling speculation about the future gets the most power to create it, regardless of whether they understand the consequences.</p><p>There's no neutral outside from which to observe these systems. We're building the tools that are rebuilding us, and it will have consequences across the board. There really isn't an offline anymore, just due to the administration. We're all participants in a cognitive economy that trades in attention, belief, and behavior. Shape the feed, shape the future. What happens when everything becomes an attention-speculation machine?</p><p><strong>Next week: Part 2,</strong> I&#8217;ll attempt to answer that question and walk through what could be built and the generational implications.

I got to try welding - trying to lay the bead exactly right. You wear a giant helmet, which turns dark with the welding torch hits the titanium. It&#8217;s just you and this little beam of fire. It&#8217;s all you can see.</p><p>On Tuesday, I was in Nashville and the parking garage connected to my hotel caught on fire at 2 a.m. We were all shuffled outside, the air thick with burning rubber. You could hear the gas tanks explode. Some people thought they were bombs. The firefighters laddered toward black, billowing smoke, and doused the garage. We shuffled back inside an hour later. I stared at the ceiling until 5 a.m., got up, did some work, spoke on stage at 10 a.m. to a wonderful crowd about the economy for young people, and then drove home to Louisville. </p><p>I am currently trying to board a flight to get out West, and fuel is pouring of the wing of the aircraft. I will certainly miss my connecting flight. In fact, the flight is entirely cancelled as I edit this.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> So I write to you, dear reader, from the airport yet again. </p><p>While I was moving between these different grounded, very physical realities this week, the news feed was offering something else.

detached-from-reality-metaphorical-thinkpiece but there is something relatively poignant about using the infrastructure of the promised future to reject that future and to also the refusal to keep pretending that this future arriving through our screens has anything to do with the reality people are living in.</p><p>The image of the Waymo on fire is a miniature of collapse, used to fuel calls for sending in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/marines-arrive-la-under-trump-orders-protests-spread-other-cities-2025-06-10/">more troops to LA than we have in Syria or Afghanistan. </a>The contradiction becomes content, the content becomes justification for more contradiction. We scroll past the burning car to see arguments about whether the burning was justified, then scroll past those to see memes about the arguments, then scroll past those to see counter-memes. The cycle feeds itself!</p><p>And somehow, we've become remarkably adaptable to living inside all of this. We navigate between realities without stopping to notice how incompatible they are. There has always been the incredible difficulty of making real things, right, the patience and skill required to weld metal without burning through it, the complexity of keeping people safe during an actual crisis. </p><p>But now we layer endless innovation theater on top - revolutionary interfaces that solve no actual problems, liquid screens that fundamentally do not matter, promises of abundance that depend entirely on erasing the people who make abundance possible.</p><p>The contradiction isn't new. What's new is how smoothly we scroll between the real work and the performance of work, between the welder's focused attention and the algorithm's demand for distraction.</p><h4><strong>The Gentle Singularity</strong></h4><p>Which brings me to Sam Altman&#8217;s essay. I want to be very clear I wholly support AI as a complement to the human experience, but certainly not as a replacement to humans.</p><p>On Tuesday, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, published a piece called <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity">"The Gentle Singularity</a>&#8221; (what a word combo). It opens with</p><blockquote><p>We are past the event horizon; the takeoff has started.</p></blockquote><p>He goes on to describe a future where intelligence becomes &#8220;too cheap to meter,&#8221; where AI drives scientific breakthroughs, and we&#8217;ll swim in lakes and wealth inequality will disappear. He writes:</p><blockquote><p>In the most important ways, the 2030s may not be wildly different. People will still love their families, express their creativity, play games, and swim in lakes.</p><p>But in still-very-important-ways, the 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before. We do not know how far beyond human-level intelligence we can go, but we are about to find out.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes when I read pieces like this - which I take very seriously, because Sam Altman is clearly at the forefront here - I wonder what world they are writing about. Right? </p><p>What sort of world is this future landing in? </p><p>He states that &#8220;the world will be getting so much richer so quickly that we&#8217;ll be able to seriously entertain new policy ideas we never could before&#8221; which feels like it entirely misunderstands human incentives. </p><p>A few days before Altman published his gentle singularity, the Cato Institute released an analysis showing that the<a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/deportations-add-almost-1-trillion-costs-gops-big-beautiful-bill"> current administration's deportation plans will cost nearly $1 trillion. </a>The "One Big Beautiful Bill" allocates $168 billion to immigration enforcement, enough to make ICE's budget nearly quadruple by 2028, enough to detain over 200,000 people at a time.</p><p>The AI systems Altman describes as ushering in this gentle abundance are being used to spread disinformation about the very protests happening in response to these deportations. According to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-chatgpt-ai-los-angeles-protest-disinformation/">a WIRED report</a>, people are turning to ChatGPT and Grok to fact-check information about the LA protests, and the AI chatbots are giving them completely fake information. Grok claimed photos of National Guard troops were from Afghanistan in 2021 when they were actually from Los Angeles last week. ChatGPT misidentified current protest footage as being from Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal.</p><p>The contradiction here is that Altman promises intelligence will become abundant just as truth becomes scarce, and promises gentleness just as violence escalates. And of course he does, that is his job, those are his incentives, and AI money operates in a nonreality! </p><p>As Altman notes in the piece, the main goal of AI is to get it aligned to humans - and states that &#8220;social media feeds are an example of misaligned AI&#8221;. This is accurate. The abundance of intelligence is being used to manufacture scarcity of truth. The same systems that will solve humanity's problems are being used to obscure the very real human cost of current policies.</p><p>Altman's gentle singularity depends on ignoring the violent present that makes it possible. The AI systems he's building require massive data centers, enormous energy consumption, and human labor to train and maintain them<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>. But his vision of abundance erases all of that friction, all of that cost, all of those people.</p><p>Joan Didion wrote in the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Album_(book)">the White Album </a>&#8220;We tell ourselves stories in order to live.&#8221; Altman's gentle singularity is one of those stories, a narrative that helps us make sense of technological change by promising it will all work out in the end. </p><p>But what happens when the story breaks down? When sitting in that airport, watching fuel pour from an aircraft wing while scrolling through news about AI armies and deportation raids, the gap between the promised narrative and lived reality becomes impossible to ignore?</p><p>Zadie Smith, writing about Facebook over a decade ago in <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/25/generation-why/">Generation Why?</a>, warned that digital life was already flattening our sense of self and &#8220;shrinking the range of human expression&#8221; to fit the logic of the platform. We are flat now. Our attention is disassembled and the contradictions are monetized. The stories we have are incompatible with the lives we&#8217;re actually living.</p><p>&#8220;From a relativistic perspective,&#8221; Altman writes, &#8220;the singularity happens bit by bit, and the merge happens slowly.&#8221; But the deportations are happening fast. The disinformation is spreading now. The contradictions aren't gentle.</p><h4><strong>The Performance of the Scroll</strong></h4><p>And what happens when you can't scroll past the contradiction anymore? When the promised future and violent present become impossible to reconcile?</p><p>To repeat - Sam Altman said that "social media feeds are an example of misaligned AI.&#8221; And boy is he right. The New York Times published a profile of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/technology/x-right-wing-influencer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.M08.avEn.2yfepDkzuWwG&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">Dominick McGee, one of the most prominent right-wing influencers on </a>Twitter which perfectly illustrates the misaligned AI in action. McGee has over 1 million followers and is one of the most influential users on the platform. He earns about $55,000 a year for eleven hours of daily labor designed to spread outrage and disinformation.</p><p>This is the misalignment. Dominick McGee is responding perfectly rationally to a completely irrational system. The algorithm rewards outrage, so he produces outrage. His response makes perfect economic sense.</p><p>My professor Dr. Chhacchhi said that the opposite of rationality isn't irrationality, it's being normal. And this is what normal looks like now - isolated creators optimizing for metrics they don't understand and producing content designed to make everyone more confused and angry.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin wrote about <a href="https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf">Omelas</a>, a beautiful, prosperous city whose abundance depended on one child suffering alone in a basement. Most citizens know about the child and accept this as the price of their perfect society. They understand that their joy depends on the child's misery, and they make peace with it. She writes: </p><blockquote><p>They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.</p></blockquote><p>But some people can't do that. They walk away from Omelas. They don&#8217;t know where they are going really. But they go. Many stay, justifying suffering of others as their way of life. </p><p>This bleeds into what Marx called this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism#:~:text=As%20a%20form%20of%20reification,the%20goods%20and%20the%20services.">commodity fetishism</a>, how we see the smooth interface, the autonomous car, the AI, but we don't see the social relations that make them possible. The data centers, the energy, the human labor all disappear behind the frictionless user experience. </p><p>When it's time for the machines to replace the people, or to acknowledge the invisible humans behind the systems that keep us fed and connected, we don't, because we've trained ourselves not to see what it actually looks like. We ignore what we don&#8217;t want to see.</p><p>Brian Merchant writes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Machine-Origins-Rebellion-Against/dp/0316487740/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OBBuS0dF3cQwLeibed9Wz7-Er3WJl8gDBL8Mtw4bIby5fKMfqKyATygr-r6HoayktVCOJhlsNxiYzgF75E0U8u7Eu2q-MmIDlVgGZLfoq8gkgN4NafcPeEk1s4B0jy-92pjsJ9KaVRGnEivXoQF-qTqDQ3m3IZ3kGUpkL9fr_A68cWIa_kpUrGc01rfDeJOW1G8zj3_69o1Eyn9t3TCvWekgQVPfL0KmJsq6kuBqrBI.wTkvynOsfOmuRVleBoukE-nuzrqGMfp_5CrwljPoHuk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=blood+in+the+machine&amp;qid=1749639959&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">'Blood in the Machine' </a>how the original Luddites weren't the anti-technology primitives of popular myth. They were skilled textile workers who understood exactly what the new machines meant. It wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;oh let&#8217;s automate stuff&#8221; it really was the destruction of their expertise and communities in service of capital accumulation. Luddites feared a particular kind of progress - the kind that annihilated skill, community, and voice in the name of efficiency.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-People-Talk-About-What/dp/1565843428">Studs Terkel </a>spent his career during a time of immense change (not too different from now) documenting in <em>Working</em> what happens to the people who do the work that makes everything else possible. He wrote:</p><blockquote><p>This book, being about work, is, by its very nature, about violence - to the spirit as well as to the body. It is about ulcers as well as accidents, about shouting matches as well as fistfights, about nervous breakdowns as well as kicking the dog around. It is, above all (or beneath all), about daily humiliations. To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us.</p></blockquote><p>He interviewed hundreds of people whose labor gets erased from our stories about progress: steelworkers, waitresses, cleaning ladies, farmers, firefighters. He talks with Roberto Acuna, a farm laborer and organizer. Roberto says:</p><blockquote><p>When people have melons or cucumber or carrots or lettuce, they don&#8217;t know how they got on their table and the consequences to the people who picked it. If I had enough money, I would take busloads of people out to the fields and into the labor camps. Then they&#8217;d know how that fine salad got on their table.</p></blockquote><p>There's a violence in making people invisible, in treating their work as just an input rather than recognizing their humanity. There is violence in ignoring the humans behind the story, ignoring the child fraught with misery in the name of progress.</p><p>Steve Bannon described the Trump strategy as "flooding the zone&#8221; where you overwhelm people with so much stimulation that they can't focus on any one thing long enough to understand it. The stories like Studs told get lost. It's the same principle that drives social media algorithms: flood your vision with everything at once so you keep scrolling instead of stopping to think.</p><p>McGee is both the child in the basement and the citizen who's made peace with it (again with these contradictions). He earns money to poison public discourse while the platform extracts billions in value from the outrage he generates. </p><p>The immigration raids happening right now follow this playbook. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/protests-los-angeles-immigrants-trump-f5089877?st=Rb6asJ&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">the WSJ reported,</a> Miller tells ICE agents to hit arrest quotas, target Home Depots and 7-Elevens, create maximum visual impact. Deploy the National Guard, send in Marines, generate footage of militarized enforcement that floods our feeds and keeps us scrolling between outrage and justification. There are <a href="https://x.com/CBSEveningNews/status/1932576335731568751">more troops than there are protestors </a>and it&#8217;s costing $134 million. Optics are policy!</p><p>The system rewards the performance of enforcement over the reality of it.</p><p>If they really wanted to solve immigration, they would read papers like <a href="https://eig.org/exceptional-by-design/">Exceptional by Design from the EIG team </a>on improving high-skilled, legal immigration. They would offer fair hearings, deport actual criminals, arrest people who are violent during protests, and help people who have been trying to get citizenship for years who pay taxes<a href="https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/"> (almost $100 billion</a> in 2022) and work hard. </p><p>We are in a system that is designed to blind, distract, and blur - the infinite scroll. Nothing is too urgent and everything is equally urgent at the same time. Nothing lands. Welding is the opposite. It&#8217;s about focusing all your vision into a single point of contact, that small bead of fire between metal and hand.</p><p>The bike factory offered a different model too. Individual skill contributing to collective knowledge, the painter who understood which coatings would last, the assembler who could feel when the derailleur was properly aligned. Each person's expertise was visible, valued, and connected to everyone else's work. </p><p>There's something important in the difference between systems where you can see how your work connects to others versus systems designed to keep those connections invisible. </p><p>Most dystopian narratives focused on authoritarian control like Big Brother watching, governments suppressing information, which we are increasingly experiencing. But one could argue that the systems that profit by drowning us in information and platforms that make money by making everyone confused and angry are even scarier. The panopticon <em>perhaps</em> is less frightening than the slot machine.</p><p>It's extraordinarily reassuring that Altman says that social media feeds are misaligned. Perhaps that's a move in the right direction, that the endless scroll is not inevitable technological progress but a specific choice about how to organize human attention. And then there is this: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg" width="463" height="517.8005591798695" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1073,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:463,&quot;bytes&quot;:158619,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/165622225?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YDAG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c9982fd-e3a8-4b71-abf6-77e47d451700_1073x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Even the AI systems themselves are resisting this!

Kyle really liked sports betting, and it seemed like he was pretty good at it! He made thousands of dollars betting in January 2023 and felt invincible. Working from home, he kept one screen for gambling, one for everything else. A dual monitor life, if you will. The confidence from his wins rewired his entire sense of reality. When his boss disagreed with him about a project, Kyle's gambling success made him overconfident enough to push back in ways he never would have before. He got fired, spent his unemployment checks on more bets, lost thousands and thousands of dollars over six months, and moved back in with his parents. "Gambling tore me apart," he told Jon. </p><h4>My Little Brother</h4><p>Kyle's story is extreme, but it's not unusual. It&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re young, wired for risk, and the system is wired to reward it, until it doesn&#8217;t. My little brother Ryan is big on sports betting, like many 20-something year olds (<a href="https://scantron.substack.com/p/vigorish-commission-and-taxes?utm_source=publication-search">he wrote a newsletter about it</a>)<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. When I asked him his thoughts on betting a few months ago, he said via voicenote:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ryan</strong>: &#8202;&#8202;Sports betting is definitely a form of entertainment for a lot of people, and I think it's pretty comparative to what we might associate Robinhood trading with. I think sports betting provides opportunity if used correctly. But I don't think it is used correctly. The marketing of it is super predatory. The whole idea is that once they get you in, you're not going to want to leave.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>He understands that "99% of people won't" approach sports betting systematically, that most people just "want to hit the big parlay... want to hit the jackpot." And he knows that the marketing is designed to hook you. </p><p>But he also sees potential value in (1) entertainment, or (2) sports betting as an easier market to beat than traditional financial ones if you really dedicate yourself. And gambling is fun, there&#8217;s a reason it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/gambling/History">one of mankind&#8217;s oldest activities! </a>His voicenote ended:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ryan</strong>: I really have slowed my betting just because it only has gotten progressively harder and I don't love losing money. And I really like the stock market too. </em></p></blockquote><p>There is a very thin line between entertainment and destruction. Both Ryan and Kyle are smart, analytically minded young men. Both understood the risks of sports betting. The difference seems to be that Kyle crossed some invisible dopamine threshold where early wins rewired his decision-making entirely, while Ryan managed to pull back when things stopped working.</p><p>Young people have come of age during what feels like the gamification of everything and human psychological limitations becoming a source of value. Day trading has become TikTok content! Crypto has become a presidential talking point! Any sort of hobby that you have can become a monetizable side hustle - and you better be monetizing, buddy!</p><p>Sports betting is part of this transformation in how we make money off attention, confidence, and cognitive bias.

They might bet this big parlay and view it in the same sense of going of trying to win the Powerball or going and getting a scratch off.</em></p></blockquote><p>Luckily, my dear friend Jon Cohen has his new book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Losing-Big-Americas-Reckless-Gambling-ebook/dp/B0DH2LQ9F5?ref_=ast_author_dp">Losing Big</a>,</em> detailing America's experiment with legalized sports betting<em> (</em>and is also the author of the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dollar-Dream-Lotteries-Modern-America/dp/0197604889">For a Dollar and a Dream</a></em>, about the American State lottery). I had the chance to talk to him about how blurry everything has become. Included throughout this piece are snippets of our interview. </p><h4><strong>In Dialogue with Jon Cohen</strong></h4><blockquote><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> Hey John, thanks so much for joining me today to talk about sports betting&nbsp;</em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> A really small topic with no direct relevance to everything happening in the world right now.</em></p></blockquote><p>We were talking about sports betting, sure - but that's not <em>really</em> what we were talking about. We were talking about how a society decides what kinds of human weaknesses are acceptable to monetize, and how quickly something can go from scandal to infrastructure when there's money to be made. Throughout Jon&#8217;s book and our conversation, there are two big ideas: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Behavioral Design</strong>: The platforms are engineered to exploit overconfidence, dopamine, and a lack of friction - especially among young men.</p></li><li><p><strong>Institutional Complicity</strong>: States, media, and markets helped normalize betting not by accident, but as a way to collect revenue.</p></li></ol><p>Our interview began as most do, with me asking an impossible question: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Kyla</strong>: After writing this book and doing all this research, what is your big opinion on what sports betting has done? So just summarize your book in one sentence. </em></p><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: &#8202;Stories like your brother. I'm like, either okay, that's totally chill and awesome and that's fine. Or I'm like, okay, this is the first step to destruction. There is nothing in-between. </em></p><p><em>A study on NFL bettors from the 2023 - 2024 season [found that] 87% of bettor accounted for a total of 1% of sportsbook revenue, which means that the vast majority of bettors are able to play safely. Then there's that other percent of players, like 3% of players that account for like 80%+ of revenue. Some of them are really rich and good for them - they can spend their money however they want. Some of them are not really rich and their dopamine pathways are rewired and they're addicted.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>So Ryan - along with most people who bet on sports - is in that 87% who contribute almost nothing to the industry's bottom line. He's an entertainment user, someone who might bet on his favorite team or analyze conference matchups he genuinely understands. </p><p>But Kyle was in the 3%, fueling the entire billion-dollar infrastructure, like the celebrity endorsements, the stadium naming rights, and the integration into live TV.</p><p>But let&#8217;s back up to the beginning - how did we get here?</p><h4><strong>The History of Sports Betting</strong></h4><blockquote><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> Could you just talk about the history and how we've ended up in this situation where so many people are being impacted and everyone's just like&#8230; *shrugs shoulders*. </em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> Really cool. Just ask a historian to summarize the history of a couple hundred year topic in three minutes.</em></p><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> Should be easy. </em></p></blockquote><p>Sports betting wasn&#8217;t always this mainstream. It wasn&#8217;t even legal in most states until about seven years ago! For most of the 20th century, sports gambling carried a moral stigma with legal penalties. Betting scandals, like the Black Sox throwing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal">1919 World Series</a> reinforced the perception that gambling corrupted the integrity of sports. This perception hardened into law in the 1990s.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> In 1989, the state of Oregon tried to legalize - not even sports gambling, it was<a href="https://www.drf.com/sports-betting/state/oregon-sports-betting#:~:text=In%201989%2C%20the%20Oregon%20Lottery,went%20into%20effect%20in%201992."> just like a weird parlay card game through their lottery </a>- Congress and the sports leagues basically freaked out and passed the Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which didn't ban sports gambling but it banned states from legalizing sports gambling. </em></p></blockquote><p>For decades, betting lived offshore, underground, or in Vegas. Then a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">2018 Supreme Court decision</a> overturned PASPA on states' rights grounds. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: And because of this court legal quirk, the Supreme Court, uncorked the champagne bottle in 2018 and it has run rampant over society ever since. </em></p></blockquote><p>It indeed has run rampant over society! We went from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose">Pete Rose </a>being a cautionary tale to announcers discussing point spreads during live games. Sports coverage now assumes you're financially invested. The language of sports journalism has absorbed the vocabulary of gambling - spreads, overs, unders, value plays. </p><p>Advertising had a lot to do with it. FanDuel and DraftKings, a duopoly who control 80-90% of the market, spent billions on a specific kind of cultural programming on redefining what it meant to be a sports fan.</p><blockquote><p>&#8202;<em><strong>Kyla</strong>: FanDuel and DraftKings were dead in the water a while ago and now they've had this massive revival. So could you talk about the role that advertising has played in bringing this to the forefront?</em></p><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: FanDuel and DraftKings got every celebrity you've ever heard of - mostly like black male celebrities like Jamie Fox and Kevin Hart. I talked to someone who worked at in the DraftKings marketing department before sports betting was legal. So this is 2017 or so, and his theory is that they want to get people who aren't crazy, weird sports fans into sports betting. And the way you do that is you get people who are like Kevin Hart and JB Smoove and Jamie Fox, who didn't play college sports. </em></p><p><em>You want to make the make sports betting feel accessible, especially for these companies that are also offering online casino games, which are like insane and even more problematic and scary than sports betting. </em></p><p><em>But to this theory of normalizing, you want to just get people acclimated to betting with the help of Jamie Fox. And with advertising at the tip of the spear, turn our sports ecosystem into a sports gambling ecosystem.</em> </p></blockquote><p>Anyone can do this, especially you, just open up the app and put your money in. Your casual sports knowledge is valuable, young man! It&#8217;s normal. Sports are about gambling now. The result was complete cultural transformation in less than a decade - and it was for <em>everyone</em>.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: Sports betting is really complicated and I still sometimes get confused about various line movements. Kevin Hart is there to make it an everyman's game. I do emphasize everyman. I think that's part of the process again, the acclimation, the normalization and letting people get used to it as part of their sports viewing experience.</em></p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s all about building out the Sports Experience of gambling while watching, and doing it at the click of a button. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: The 30,000 foot level goal is the normalization of sports gambling - or even the normalization of just a second screen experience where you're watching TV over there and you have your phone open with your sportsbook open on the same side. All advertising is meant to build familiarity and enthusiasm for the brand, but it&#8217;s also as much about just normalizing this activity.</em></p><p><em>A lot of people were not gambling before 2018. It was too scandalous. It was too hard to access. You had to buy Bitcoin and transfer the Bitcoin to cash and then gamble with that. But now you can just use your phone, use your debit card, use your PayPal account and they are trying to normalize that.</em> </p></blockquote><p>Previous eras had gambling, sure. People have always bet on sports, bought lottery tickets, speculated on markets. But never before have we simultaneously decided that every opinion should be monetizable (prediction markets), every social connection should generate revenue (dating apps), every creative impulse should become a side hustle (creator economy), every moment of boredom should be captured for advertising dollars (infinite scroll), and every sports opinion should become a financial position (sports betting). I do this! We all do!</p><p>We looked at the full spectrum of human psychological experience and asked: how can each of these become a profit center? </p><h4><strong>The State, The Platform, and the Hen House</strong></h4><p>Cultural normalization via two screens is only half the equation. For sports betting to become infrastructure, it needed political legitimacy. When Jon started researching how states legalized sports betting, he expected to find a story about regulatory capture like <em>&#8220;Local Lawmaker Gets Hoodwinked By Sophisticated Lobbying Campaigns and Caught Flat-footed by Industry Promises They Didn't Understand&#8221;. </em>He found something worse.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: The case study I have in my book is about Colorado. There was a lawmaker in Colorado who's genuinely really into sports betting and was happy to go along with basically whatever the companies wanted. So this was not, as I was expecting, like state capture and lobbying. It was basically the hens enthusiastically opening the doors to the hen house.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sports betting became policy because it promised money during COVID. Lawmakers needed revenue without raising taxes. Betting looked like an easy win. It wasn&#8217;t.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: A lot of states passed sports betting during COVID when they had more acute financial needs and they were basically being offered a free source of revenue that didn't require any taxes. Why wouldn't they say yes? </em></p></blockquote><p>What elected official wants to be the one who said no to free money during a budget crisis? What lawmaker wants to explain to constituents that they opposed something that could fund schools or infrastructure without requiring tax increases? But the revenue math never worked. </p><p>Kansas expected ~$100 million annually but collected $12 million in 2023 - less than half of one percent of the $2.8 billion wagered <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/05/14/sportsbooks-sports-gambling-prop-bets-state-tax-jontay-porter/">according to the Washington Post. </a>Arizona projected $100 million but got $26 million. Colorado expected a 10% effective tax rate but promotional deductions cut it to under 5%.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: You'll be shocked to hear that's not exactly what FanDuel and DraftKings promised when these states were considering legalizing in the first place</em></p></blockquote><p>States themselves have become gamblers too, in a way! </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: Red and blue lawmakers alike have shown that they're just total suckers when it comes to gambling revenue. They'll just say yes to anything because it seems too good to pass up. </em></p></blockquote><p>As Jon argues in his lottery book, the real problem isn't individual, it's institutional:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: The thesis of my lottery book is that it's easy to look down on lottery players for being irrational and stupid for wasting all their money on these hopeful impossible dreams of a lottery ticket. But the only reason we have lotteries in the first place is because lawmakers and taxpayers wasted their impossible dreams of a tax free bonanza for the state on a lottery ticket. </em></p><p><em>So first of all, that's why I don't call a lottery a stupid tax because we're all stupid and we just condemn it when it's poor and non-white people who are buying lottery tickets. So I think if you want to distribute the blame it lies a little bit with these companies for these false promises.</em></p></blockquote><p>States become stakeholders in an industry built on extracting money from their own citizens. The worse people like Kyle get at gambling, the more money the state makes.</p><h4><strong>The Dopamine Business Model</strong></h4><p>We tend to think gambling danger lives in losing streaks and desperation, but Kyle's story shows how success becomes the actual problem. The confidence that comes from early wins creates the sense that you've discovered some edge that separates you from all the other suckers. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: You win your first bet, and you get really high off of the dopamine from it. That's how they get you. That 'I won my first bet on Marquette, so I must be awesome at sports betting'&#8212; [bettors] don&#8217;t realize that's actually the dangerous part in how they get you.</em></p></blockquote><p>Kyle made $4,000 in January and felt "invincible." That confidence might have made him bold in betting, but it torched his work, his relationships, and his entire sense of reality. When his boss disagreed with him about a project, Kyle's recent gambling wins made him overconfident enough to push back in ways he never would have before. He got fired.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: The FanDuel ad right now is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1-cwX74CqM">Never Waste a Hunch</a> - [making you think] that you know more about sports and you can leverage that to make money.

A hunch becomes a commodity and a casual thought like &#8220;I think the Knicks are going to win tonight&#8221; becomes something to be priced. Something that <em>shouldn&#8217;t be wasted!</em></p><p>And what if the platforms aren't neutral markets rewarding good analysis? What if they&#8217;re designed to exploit your <em>belief</em> in your analysis?</p><p>When Jon talks about how dangerous early wins are, he&#8217;s really describing the gamified version of self-confirmation. You feel like you&#8217;re right, and that your rightness should scale. It&#8217;s a statement of sorts: <em>I know something. I see something. And that makes me valuable.</em></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: It's at your highest winningest moments that are the most dangerous. This is the design of the No Sweat, First Bet promo because they want you to win your first bet. This is literally the plot of the Gambler by Dostoyevsky from 50 years ago - when you win your first bet is how you build out the sense of overconfidence that will be really hard to shake</em></p></blockquote><p>The marketing of sports betting is very precise: young men like Kyle (and Ryan) who are statistically prone to overconfidence, hit during the exact developmental window when their prefrontal cortex is still forming and their financial lives are most fragile. <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/docs/default-source/academics-documents/academics-jandoli-school/asfs24-crosstabs---release-2-online-sports-betting.pdf">39% of men aged 18-49 now have online betting accounts.</a> And they bet.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: The impacts are being born disproportionately by younger men - the rates of problematic or hazardous gambling or even just having a bad week and losing a couple thousand dollars more than you intended to, which is probably the most common sort of harm and negative side effect. </em></p><p><em>Polling indicates that <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-finds-online-betting-leads-to-problems-for-young-men/">pluralities of young men between the ages of 18 to 35 </a>say this has happened to them at least once: that they've been unable to pay one of their bills because of gambling losses. If it's happening to that many people, there's clearly some phenomenon going on, something that is rooted in both gender and society. And it's not just a coincidence anymore.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Pluralities</em> of an entire demographic unable to pay bills because of gambling losses. For college students, the environment creates what Jon calls "trip wires everywhere." Sports culture, peer competition, underdeveloped impulse control, and apps designed to prey on overconfidence.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: It seems like drinking, right? Just to take the college student analogy, which is you can drink safely, you can even drink a lot and it might give you a hangover, but it's not going to have any long-term consequences. You can also drink and even just one night of unsafe drinking can ruin your life in the same way that gambling can for a young person, right?</em></p><p><em>[In gambling] you either you lose literally all your money and you can't pay your bills or it can start a process of addiction that lasts a long time. College students are in an environment where sports are central, they're surrounded by culture, let's say at a fraternity house, by other young men who also love sports. And they're encouraged to prove that they're smarter than their friends about sports by betting on sports because they can make money off of it. And you can just see all of these things alone might be okay, but they're all compounded together.</em></p></blockquote><p>How do you exercise personal responsibility against a system designed by teams of behavioral psychologists and data scientists specifically to defeat your capacity for rational decision-making? I genuinely don't know.</p><h4>The Language of Individual Responsibility </h4><p>One thing that clearly frustrates Jon is how the industry weaponizes the language of personal responsibility:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: &#8202;I'd love to actually talk about the phrase, please play responsibly. I think each of those three words is so interesting. It's like the warning labels on cigarettes, which is just ingeniously worded and so insidiously worded. It's like &#8220;Okay, please Kyle, I'm asking you to play responsibly. Putting the onus on you as a result to be the one in charge of your own play.&#8221; They can't even say the word gamble! It's not even please gamble responsibly! It's like play. It's fun, it's light, it's easy. This is not gambling, it's just playing. And then responsibly, same thing. I think the true function of responsible gambling campaigns and ads is to put the onus of responsibility onto the individual rather than the billion dollar corporation that is offering them the chance to bet on Malaysian women's doubles badminton at 3am.</em></p><p><em>I don't want to say people don't stand a chance, but again, there's just all these like landmines or trip wires or however you want to put it in front of people that both make it easy for them to get addicted, and then when they do, it's basically implying that it's their fault and that they should have been more responsible.</em></p><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> How would you phrase it to capture the corporation's responsibility? </em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> That's a good question. I don't know. There are people who do this who think about responsible gambling and how to improve responsible gambling all the time. And no one listens to them, but they do have actual ideas about campaigns. I don't know if I'm smart enough to have an off the cuff amazing advertising copy.</em></p><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> Yeah. Maybe it's like It's Our Fault.</em></p><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: Don't gamble, asshole. </em></p></blockquote><p>When Kyle lost his job, his savings, his ability to function, the message was that he should have played more responsibly. That this was his fault. It&#8217;s complicated. Traditional gambling required physical presence, social interaction, choice. The current system eliminates all friction, all social context, all natural stopping points.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: So the word that's used in the subtitle of the book is Reckless&#8212;and not because gambling is reckless, but the way we rolled it out in the United States and the fashion in which it has been set up here is reckless. I'm quoting here from a 1976 gambling Congressional gambling commission - but you know that gambling is inevitable, right? As a human activity, as a human pastime. </em></p><p><em>Also I think it's fun, right? Not everything that's fun should be legal, but I think gambling does happen to be fun. The question is like &#8220;Okay, just because something's fun, should that mean that you should be able to bet in the middle of the night on like Malaysian women's doubles badminton through the state of Colorado?&#8221; </em></p><p><em>That to me is where you get past the point of oh, this is inevitable, so we might as well legalize and make money off of it. We are now inculcating gambling and creating a new generation of gamblers and soliciting gambling that wouldn't have been happening otherwise.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Many people compare it to other vices, but Jon points out that gambling is a very specific type of cognitive capture. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> That's the loop of gambling, right? You're like, &#8220;oh, I'm in the hole. I just need to gamble some more and I'll get out of the hole.&#8221; It's such a nasty cycle.</em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> It&#8217;s unlike drugs or alcohol in that way. There's no reason that you'd expect &#8220;oh, if I have another shot of vodka, it will cure all the negative effects of my alcohol addiction&#8221;. Theoretically, like if you hit the Milwaukee Bucks over tomorrow night, it could wipe out all of your debt. So you just keep chasing and keep chasing. </em></p><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> Yeah. And you never really get there, do you? </em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> I have yet to find a bettor who went down so far, got even and then was able to stop. This one guy profiled in the book got down a lot of money. He basically broke even. But he was like, no, I was, I used to be up $40,000. I need to get back up $40,000. And then of course, it's chasing that last $40,000 that he quote unquote lost, that he runs back in trouble and falls right back into debt and the whole cycle begins again.</em></p></blockquote><p>The addiction is built around a logical premise, that somehow the next bet could actually solve all the problems created by previous bets.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: What I'm saying is that has always happened. There have always been Kyles in American history, but never has the government and corporations made it so easy to have that exact experience and to have it from their couch.</em></p></blockquote><h4><strong>The Human Cost</strong></h4><p>The worst-case scenario is documented in places that got there first.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: Gambling addiction is the addiction most closely associated with suicide compared to every other directly, formally categorized addictive behavior in the diagnostic and statistical manuals. And this is what sparked the&#8212;we'll call it a reckoning&#8212;over gambling policy and over legalizing online gambling in the United Kingdom: a wave of suicides of young men who had developed gambling addiction."</em></p></blockquote><p>The UK data: young men with problem gambling show <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788474/">9x higher suicide attempt rates</a>. Public Health England estimates<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/04/bereaved-families-demand-investigation-of-every-uk-gambling-linked-suicide"> 409 gambling-related suicides per year </a>in England alone.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: So that's the absolute worst case scenario is basically a lot of young men taking their own lives because of gambling addiction in the sense that if they were to disappear, their gambling debts and their addiction were to disappear. Once you unleash gambling [it could] lead to increased rates of people taking their own lives. </em></p><p><em>And then working down a couple layers of harm, as illustrated in these two SSRM papers that came out over the summer, increased bankruptcies, increased credit card delinquencies, reduced investment in the stock market and reduced savings among families that bet a lot of money. We are already seeing direct evidence of that. Just financial insecurity or people wagering their financial futures, quite literally. You're probably more qualified than me to know what the long-term consequences of that are of a 20 something year old losing all their money but I know it's not good I'll tell you that.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Kyle moved back in with his parents, his career derailed, his finances destroyed. But he survived. Many don't.</p><h4><strong>What Comes After Sports Betting?</strong></h4><p>New players have emerged with even more aggressive and exciting models.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: There have been all these big gray market gambling operators that have rolled out under the guise of prediction markets. You can bet on the NCAA tournament in all 50 states, even in states that haven't legalized sports betting.</em></p><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> The Robinhood-Kalshi agreement. </em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> Yes, which apparently received the blessing of the CFTC, which I have no idea how. I'm all for the shitting we've done on DraftKings and Fanduel, but I think there's a chance that within a few years we will look at them as the most benign and responsible providers of sports gambling. </em></p><p><em>Kalshi and Robinhood are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to offshore sportsbooks or this Sports Illustrated branded peer-to-peer betting program that might be being rolled out that is claiming that it can exist by being totally unregulated because it's peer-to-peer rather than with a house. </em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2025/robinhood-sports-prediction-market-kalshi-deal-1234854394/">Kalshi x Robinhood</a> represents something potentially more&#8230; interesting than traditional sportsbooks because it's wrapped in the language of financial markets rather than entertainment. They're not running a casino, right, they're building a financial exchange. They don't set odds; they facilitate trades between users.</p><p>It's Uber logic: we're just the platform! </p><p>If you can eventually bet on everything from the weather to election outcomes to celebrity behavior through the same interface you use to buy stocks (which is an interesting and engaging thing to do) - where do we even go from there?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: DraftKings and FanDuel have built the noose that'll be used to hang them. They normalized betting as a practice as something that's a part of American society over the last seven years. Why should we be surprised that there are going to be innovators and other companies that are trying to disrupt the framework that they're building and that [these companies] are going to be more aggressive, are going to try to be less regulated and be more aggressive in their pursuit of customers and in their offerings? </em></p></blockquote><p>What makes the newer platforms particularly concerning is their lack of even the minimal safeguards traditional sportsbooks maintain.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: As totally ineffective as I think the responsible gambling campaigns are from the big companies, at least they have them. At least they're trying. At least they have people at their companies who are well-meaning and will show up when a regulator says, 'Oh, we need to talk to you about your practices.' Whereas some of these other companies aren't even gonna have that.</em></p><p><em>So I'm a little sympathetic to these companies because again, I think there's a chance that they might look like the most responsible providers, but they're also responsible for the situation in the first place because of how fast they wanted to move at the beginning, and how recklessly again they tried to proceed.</em></p></blockquote><p>If uncertainty of Kyles everywhere can be monetized, why limit it to sports? Why not monetize every form of human uncertainty - political, cultural, personal, financial? Why not turn every moment of doubt into a transaction opportunity?</p><h4><strong>How Do We Fix This?</strong></h4><blockquote><p><em><strong>Kyla:</strong> We're going to have to totally revamp the curriculum for kids. It's going to have to be gambling literacy and porn literacy and AI literacy and deep fake literacy. There's just going to be a whole new world. I do think the 25 to 35-year-old range is a guinea pig for all of this stuff. My point of hope is that we'll take the lessons learned from the consequences that have been bestowed upon this generation and hopefully the kiddos coming along won't be so fried.</em></p><p><em><strong>Jon:</strong> A journalist I talked to once called it a nation of beta testers. It&#8217;s a generation of beta testers.</em></p></blockquote><p>Kyle and Ryan are both guinea pigs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> for what happens when every dopamine pathway becomes monetized. Kyle and Ryan are both full of analytical confidence, competitive drive, technological fluency and it serves them really well in other contexts. Kyle got caught in the machinery. Ryan managed to recognize when to pull back - and that&#8217;s good. Tests help you adapt and learn and develop immunity. There is hope!</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: I don't want to be another liberal who's like everything's bad and nothing is good. I do think that the cultural work would be really important and would be really impactful.</em></p><p><em>I do think there are some concrete ideas that would actually make things safer that would remove some of these trip wires and these landmines. I don't think you should be able to bet on minor league British Darts. I don't think you should be able to bet as much as you want without ever having to provide proof of income and provide proof of how much money you have.</em></p><p><em>I do think that a destigmatization effort or a counter narrative to the advertising would play a big role. I think it could and should be part of high school curricula to talk to kids about gambling... we try to give them some counter narrative so it's not, 'Oh, Jamie Foxx is gambling on a piano, it's really cool, I should try it.'</em></p></blockquote><p>We need gambling literacy alongside digital literacy, financial literacy, media literacy<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>. We have to understand how these systems work!</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Jon</strong>: Even just telling people how that process works&#8212;that when you win your first bet, that's actually the dangerous part, that's how they get you&#8212;I don't think people realize that. The house always wins, which is true in this case because if you do start winning, they'll just limit you and limit your gambling. So you don't actually have any prospects of making money in sports gambling, and that should be your mentality going into it.</em></p></blockquote><p>Jon&#8217;s book is incredible, and it opened my eyes to the very complex problem we have before us. I don&#8217;t know much, but what I do know is that sports betting isn't really about sports betting. It's about what happens when we reduce all friction and turn uncertainty into a profit center.</p><p>Each platform promises control, skill, edge and all are designed to extract maximum value from your inability to stop. Exploitation is in the language of freedom!</p><p>We are all living in the experimental phase of an economy built on extracting value from human psychological vulnerability<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>. We've built a democracy that literally depends on citizen irrationality for some parts of revenue, then wonder why our political discourse feels increasingly unmoored from reality. Everyone is responding to incentives, all of the time. But the incentives are increasingly misaligned. </p><p>The house always wins, you know? But what happens when the house is <em>everywhere</em>?<br>In your pocket, your feed, your brain. And what kind of society are we building if it&#8217;s powered by our worst instincts?</p><p><em>Jon Cohen's book "Losing Big: America's Reckless Experiment with Sports Betting" documents America&#8217;s experiment with sports betting and is available wherever books are sold.&nbsp;</em></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Steel tariffs doubled today also, so that&#8217;s something not great. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/04/nx-s1-5422248/trump-steel-aluminum-50-tariffs-double-prices">NPR has a good piece on it.</a></p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>It&#8217;s also his birthday! </p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-anchor-3" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">3</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Read Michael Mauboussin on that!</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-anchor-4" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">4</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>This is completely tangential but I thought these <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Slides_London.pdf">slides on the Demographic Future of Humanity</a> were an interesting pairing with this idea</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-5" href="#footnote-anchor-5" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">5</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>At the exact moment that education and learning are under immense threat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/trump-federal-spending-grants-scientists-leaving.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">we need it most</a></p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-6" href="#footnote-anchor-6" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">6</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t even really talk about AI in this piece - t<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ai-is-learning-to-escape-human-control-technology-model-code-programming-066b3ec5">here was an interesting WSJ op-ed about the models getting really good at hiding how good they are </a>and some<a href="https://www.bondcap.com/reports/tai"> good slides from Bond</a></p></div></div> ]]>

It looks like it will go in front of the Supreme Court, which will be a big test of the institutions of the 21st century. But legally, Trump got TACO&#8217;ed - there is now a ruling that indeed, <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1927767446863114302">Trump Does Always Chicken Out.</a> What will he do next? <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-tariffs-court-rulings/682964/">Stephen Miller already called it a &#8216;judicial coup&#8217;. </a></p><p>And that&#8217;s what I want to talk about today - what happens when we experience massive technological change at the same time that the institutions meant to help manage that change are being dismantled or threatened or ignored?</p><h4>The Invisible Rules</h4><p>The other day, I was biking up a steep (Steep!) grade, and a girl - holding two phones - stepped into the middle of the road and just&#8230; stopped. Right in front of me! Not a flinch. I swerved and kind of laughed and then thought: <em>Wait, is this real? Or am I in some kind of dream?</em></p><p>Because it kind of <em>feels</em> like that lately. Like the invisible rules that used to hold everything together like the rules about paying attention, about looking out for one another, about knowing where you&#8217;re supposed to be are just&#8230; gone.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. No one is where they&#8217;re supposed to be (at least, according to the Societal Rulebook&#8482;&#65039;). </p><p>And that is sort of how everything feels right now? This constant weaving and waning through traffic littered with people not really paying attention or sucked in their alternate phone reality in ways that makes you want to shake your fist to the sky. </p><p>Meanwhile, I keep seeing these little delivery robots, zooming down sidewalks, sitting patiently at crosswalks, delivering a single KitKat or something to someone in the middle of Mar Vista. They are intentionally cheerful (the googly eyes) scouts from a future that&#8217;s already here, waiting for someone, anyone to put in an order. </p><p>Meanwhile, humans sit in nearby parking lots, scrolling phones in idling cars, also waiting for someone, anyone&#8230; The robots know exactly where they're going. The humans&#8230; don't? </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png" width="613" height="477.02957486136785" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:842,&quot;width&quot;:1082,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:613,&quot;bytes&quot;:1655858,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/164588971?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Vqd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc31feb5e-9fa4-4f9a-88f5-2ba240ab5046_1082x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Robots don&#8217;t need sleep or a 401k.

These phases overlap, feed into each other, contradict themselves. But they help explain what&#8217;s going on right now. Why everything feels like it&#8217;s&#8230; eroding.</p><h4>Phase One: Trust Erosion</h4><p><em>Institutions remain, but people stop believing they work for them.</em></p><p>We are here! More and more, human labor is coordinated by algorithm: CRMs, KPIs, valuation models, algorithmic feeds. Every software-based industry is part of this number-centric system (which is many industries). Not inherently bad! But it leaves a lot of people with the job title <em>Biological API</em>, or humans executing digital instructions.</p><p>At the same time, institutions are being politically captured (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/27/harvard-contracts-trump-federal-funding/">apparently universities have to align with the administration</a>). Science funding gets cut for ideological reasons. Economic policy becomes kayfabe and theater. Etc. When everything becomes political, expertise becomes just another opinion to be negotiated rather than a constraint to be respected.</p><p>What breaks here is <em>trust</em> (the thing I never stop writing about). Institutions remain, but people stop believing they work for them.</p><h4>Phase Two: Knowledge Erosion</h4><p><em>Institutions stop functioning as engines of competence transfer.</em></p><p>We're already seeing the systematic dismissal of technical knowledge - Tom Nichols wrote a whole book on it, so none of this is new. Climate science becomes "liberal bias," and epidemiology becomes "a control agenda" or whatever. </p><p>At the same time, unemployment among college graduates is rising faster than for other groups <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/student-loans-economy-f6a11598?mod=e2tw">(at the same time that student loan payments are starting back up).</a> There are very real economic consequences here. The value of higher education is being questioned while the cost remains the same (or rises). </p><p>And then there&#8217;s the labor market. LinkedIn's Chief Economic Opportunity Officer Aneesh Raman recently compared the surge of automation to the collapse of US manufacturing in the 1980s in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/linkedin-ai-entry-level-jobs.html">NYT Op-ed</a>.</p><blockquote><p>We saw what happened in the 1980s when our manufacturing sector steeply declined. Now it is our office workers who are staring down the same kind of technological and economic disruption. </p><p>Breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder.</p></blockquote><p>The change is slow. An IBM survey <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/05/25/ai-entry-level-jobs-gen-z-careers-young-workers-linkedin/">shows that 3 in 4 AI initiatives fail to deliver promised ROI</a> (perhaps because implementation costs exceed immediate benefits). But entry-level positions where young people once cut their teeth (like debugging simple code, basic legal research, administrative tasks, or what I did in my first job, putting numbers in a spreadsheet) are increasingly (expected to be) handled by AI. </p><p>That&#8217;s the rung Raman was talking about. And if that rung disappears, what is left for the people trying to climb?</p><p>This shift creates a two-track economy: fully automated work (data analysis, customer service, financial calculations) done by AI versus remaining human domains (complex negotiation, creative problem-solving, emotional support) that can be done by humans. </p><p>But to fully enter Phase Two here and takeover remaining human domains, the questions have to get weirder and weirder and then you feel like you&#8217;re trapped in some seventh circle of San Francisco hell - with questions like &#8220;How do you scale empathy? How do you metrics-ize the kind of relationship-building that really drives sales? How can we operationalize the human spirit?&#8221;</p><p>So: the technical knowledge is being dismissed, the early career pathways are collapsing, and we&#8217;re now trying to automate what&#8217;s left of the human stuff too.</p><p><em>What breaks here is knowledge transfer.</em> Institutions stop functioning as engines of intergenerational competence and we lose people entering the system who might have fixed it. </p><h4>Phase Three: Capacity Erosion</h4><p><em>Rebuilding when no one can</em></p><p>Here, institutions break down physically and economically. This is decay beyond job loss. Some of it is already happening. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/college-towns-economy-macomb-illinois-aae84dcc?mod=e2tw">has an incredible piece on the bust of small college towns in the face of the </a>demographic crisis that I mentioned earlier - focusing on Macomb, Illinois, where Western Illinois University enrollment has dropped 47% since 2010. </p><p>These are stories about fertility rates<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> and federal funding cuts, and what happens when (1) the population ages and (2) the university model gets challenged. Automation has no answer for this. As the WSJ reports - </p><blockquote><p>Of students choosing to enter college, more of them are aiming for prestigious universities, believing those diplomas will get them better jobs, said Richard Vedder, an economist at Ohio University who studies higher education. &#8220;It&#8217;s a flight to quality,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>But, this won&#8217;t work, because the US government is actively trying to destroy universities too, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/us-will-revoke-visas-of-chinese-students-escalating-crackdown?srnd=homepage-americas">revoking student visas for Chinese students</a> and suspending federal funding,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/how-harvard-is-getting-rocked-by-trump-s-america-first-fight?srnd=homepage-americas"> among other things.</a> China produces almost half of the world&#8217;s top AI researchers <a href="https://archivemacropolo.org/interactive/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/">and nearly 40% of AI talent in the US is Chinese</a>. Many who get <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-long-term-stay-rates-of-international-stem-phd-graduates/">PhDs choose to stay in the US after graduating.</a> </p><p>We benefit from these systems, and destroying them is strategically incoherent.</p><p>What breaks here is capacity. Even if we wanted to build new institutions, there's too much political infighting and too little focus on functional outcomes. You can&#8217;t rebuild if you&#8217;ve dismantled the builders.</p><h4>Phase Four: Algorithmic Substitution</h4><p><em>The machine doesn&#8217;t just do the job. It becomes the institution.</em></p><p>Once trust, knowledge, and capacity erode, algorithms replace. This is about algorithmic systems bypassing democratic institutions entirely.</p><p>This could happen. It would be algorithmic systems bypassing <strong>democratic institutions entirely</strong>. Decision-making, distribution, prioritization all offloaded to markets, engagement metrics, and predictive software.</p><p>This is why <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/29/trump-crypto-dinner-investigation-democrats/">Trump's crypto dinner with the weird rubbery steak matters more than just dollar amounts </a>- it represents the emergence of alternative power structures (a version of the parallel economy that<a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-parallel-economy-and-the-new"> I wrote about a few months ago</a>). Access is granted through memecoins and vibes! Not competence.</p><p>Markets become more important than administration. Automation displaces expertise. Young people prefer influencers over institutions. This is the rise of structures that don&#8217;t require institutional competence at all, but instead require vitality and optimization and crowd psychology. </p><p>And for better or worse, Trump is the first human-algorithm hybrid president - governing via Truth Social truths, bond market reactions, and direct market signals. A feedback loop in a suit.</p><p><em>What breaks here is a version of democracy.</em> Algorithms bypass institutions, but institutions were our only mechanism for managing complexity at scale.</p><h4>Political Optimization</h4><p>Part of our problem right now, as many have detailed, is that our institutions are designed for the 20th-century (stable demographics, predictable technology, contained information flows) and we really don&#8217;t have that structure anymore - we have 21st century realities, like exponential change and global information networks. </p><p>Harold Robertson has an interesting piece from 2023 in Palladium<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a> titled<a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/"> Complex Systems Won&#8217;t Survive the Competence Crisis</a> that touches on the increasing complexity of everything and the decreasing competency of people involved:</p><blockquote><p>In straightforward work, declining competency means that things happen more slowly, and products are lower quality or more expensive. </p><p>In complex systems, declining competency results in catastrophic failures.</p></blockquote><p>Complex systems are complex! And when they get stupid, three things happen: redundancy consumption (drawing down institutional reserves), complexity reduction (making things simpler but less capable), and risk externalization (pushing problems to other systems). But eventually, things stop working. And the <em>competence crisis</em> gives AI a market demand, a reason to exist, an economic justification to replace existing institutions.</p><p>Implementation costs are still high, human oversight is still needed, most people still prefer talking to a human, there are regulatory barriers in place, etc. The timeline is longer than the hype suggests, but it&#8217;s still there. </p><p>We have a true, bright test of whether complex technological civilization is compatible with democratic political optimization. </p><p>But we&#8217;re applying 20th-century frameworks like job retraining, education reform, social safety nets to a fundamentally different kind of economic transformation. These assume the basic structure of human-necessary work will persist, just in different forms. It might&#8230; not? I think it will. But we don&#8217;t seem to be prepared for the alternative (as many have discussed).</p><p>And we may be approaching a phase transition where the underlying structure changes state entirely. The question now is how to navigate the transition to whatever comes next, which is where people like Tyler Cowen are really helpful. Previous technological transitions succeeded because societies built institutional capacity to manage change. The industrial revolution created labor protections, public education, and financial regulations. </p><p>We need equivalent institution-building for the algorithmic age, but first, we need to stop demolishing the knowledge infrastructure we already have! This means doing obvious things like protecting science funding, maintaining international academic relationships, and preserving institutional memory even as we adapt to new realities. </p><p>I often think of Jerome Powell and what he is thinking right now and how hard his job is at the moment. His advice is have integrity and guard it carefully. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afc28dce-ed2b-430d-8a7e-0ac5ed442eff'">As he said in his Princeton commencement address</a> &#8220;Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life&#8221; He is right. The machines know where they&#8217;re going. The humans have been waiting in the parking lot for years. Maybe it&#8217;s time to decide where we&#8217;re going too.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

of the three rating agencies, downgraded US debt last Friday, in the face of ever-expanding spending and interest payment ratio problem, and the unwillingness to address it for decades. The bond market responded, with the 30Y Treasury jumping above 5% (which is the bond market&#8217;s way of screaming &#8220;please address your budget problems we are worried about the future&#8221;). This is all happening at the same time that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/japan-s-20-year-bond-auction-gets-weakest-demand-since-2012">Japan is losing total control of </a><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/japan-s-20-year-bond-auction-gets-weakest-demand-since-2012">their</a></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/japan-s-20-year-bond-auction-gets-weakest-demand-since-2012"> bond market </a>which, if not contained, could lead to cascading effects across the world. </p><p>So yes, the spiral feels real. I&#8217;ve felt it, too. It's hard to stay present when the present has been hollowed out into a scroll. When certainty becomes consumption, and consumption replaces meaning. </p><p>So, at the bookstore, I found a slightly battered, used copy of one of my favorite books, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, C.S. Lewis&#8217;s incredible fictionalized correspondence from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, on how to sabotage the human soul. The terrain was familiar - Screwtape loved talking about anxiety, fear, distraction, and the slow hollowing of the self.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.&#8221; - The Screwtape Letters</em></p></blockquote><p>In <em>Screwtape</em>, evil doesn&#8217;t arrive through fire and fury. It creeps in through ease, comfort, and optimization. Screwtape wants to nudge people into passivity as a way of capturing their souls. Let them scroll. Let them spend.

It accepts 1,950. </p></li><li><p>Goldman Sachs receives over 315,000 applications for 2,700 internships. </p></li><li><p>The average knowledge-worker job posting now receives 244 applications &#8212; more than double 2019 levels.</p></li><li><p>Students regularly apply to hundreds of jobs - just to maybe get one callback.</p></li></ul><p>Brooks writes about the world of &#8216;competitive exclusion&#8217; (rejection as a way of life) and quotes research showing its long-term psychological toll: less empathy, more aggression, lower self-control. Rejection threatens our core needs - belonging, agency, competence. There is some financial nihilism baked in. He writes:</p><blockquote><p>She told me that none of her friends are doing long-term thinking or saving for a mortgage. The world seems so radically unstable to them that they&#8217;d rather enjoy what they can today than sacrifice now for some possibility that may never come to pass two decades from now</p></blockquote><p>But mostly, it&#8217;s a lot of young people trying very, very hard in a world that isn&#8217;t making any room for them. </p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one&#8212;the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.&#8221; - The Screwtape Letters</em></p></blockquote><p>Part of it is a feature of convenience. Online applications were meant to democratize access. But when everyone can apply, no one gets seen. In removing that friction, we unintentionally created seemingly infinite supply which is handled by algorithmic culling - and there is no real feedback loop, no human warmth, no dignity in the process (Brooks calls it the seventh circle of Indeed hell). And that sort of rejection is now the default condition of economic life.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;One young man told me the system caused him to value security and stability above all&#8212;to find a place where he wouldn't be vulnerable to the next rejection.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is what Screwtape would call a slow erosion of spirit. Humans in a perpetual state of anxiety, constantly questioning their worth, experiencing rejection not as an occasional setback but as the default condition of existence.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been watching Lauren Greenfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/social-studies">Social Studies</a> series<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>, featuring a group of teens going back to high school post-pandemic, and following them through the world as they navigate parties and school and being young. </p><p>One girl built her entire life around getting into Stanford. She has a podcast on health and wellness, took college classes at UCLA, has a perfect GPA, volunteers, is a yoga teacher - basically, has a resume that should glow and levitate off the application stack. She got rejected. She got rejected from her other ten choices too. </p><p>To see that happen - to see almost ten years of dreaming get completely and totally crushed, and to know that rejection might be what she faces the rest of her life is devastating. The hard work didn&#8217;t pay off in the way she expected, and there is no real answer to it, because of course Stanford can't accept everyone! They&#8217;re Stanford! Of course companies need to filter somehow. </p><p>The system makes perfect sense on paper. But we've built an economy that functions as an industrial-scale rejection machine, and then we wonder why young people seem anxious, risk-averse, and increasingly detached.</p><p>When you combine this constant rejection with the pressure to maintain a perfect digital presence, you get a generation caught in an impossible bind: expected to pursue opportunities aggressively while simultaneously protecting themselves emotionally from the near-certain rejection that follows. It's exactly the kind of spiritual fatigue that Lewis warned about - the quiet, whimpering despair of perpetual inadequacy.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Satan and his devils want a whole race perpetually in pursuit of the rainbow's end, never honest, nor kind, nor happy now, but always using as mere fuel wherewith to heap the altar of the Future every real gift which is offered them in the Present.&#8221; - The Screwtape Letters</em></p></blockquote><p>And we might have to just rethink all of this. Rejection can be recalibration. One of the best ways to get wealthy in the US is to own a medium-size regional business, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/making-money-wealth-boring-8cc6c2cd?mod=e2tw">as reported by the WSJ. </a>They are boring and lucrative and many of their owners are retiring. The shiny path of perfection might be the endless path of rejection - but there are alternatives. </p><h4>Convenience </h4><p>Meanwhile, life has never been easier to <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-most-valuable-commodity-in-the">outsource as I wrote about a few weeks ago. </a>You can get a burrito, a dopamine hit, and a loan in mere seconds, and certainly it has no repercussions&#8230; right? </p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/restaurant-takeout-trend-national-restaurant-association-report-2025-11733929?utm_source=chatgpt.com">National Restaurant Association&#8217;s 2025 report,</a> 75% of restaurant traffic is now takeout and 60% of Gen Z and Millennials are ordering more takeout than they did last year. Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later giant, recently <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/store/5130c1b0-9c21-4870-b7ed-b610f1e820f7/DoorDash/pay-with-klarna/">partnered with DoorDash</a> to let you finance a burrito. But their losses are mounting, with defaults up 17% year-over-year. </p><p>Who could have seen this coming! Buy-now-pay-later apps are bleeding cash as users default on $12 tacos. Convenience is infrastructure now, and a great cost. </p><p>This is the <em>Convenience Contradiction</em><strong> </strong>that I&#8217;ve written about before <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/how-dating-apps-contribute-to-the">in regards to dating apps</a>: the more we optimize for effortlessness, the less resilient we become. And the more fragile our systems get, the more anxious we are, so of course we reach for even more convenience to soothe ourselves.</p><p>What Lewis understood so clearly was that small choices, repeated daily, shape our character more profoundly than dramatic one-time decisions. He would see our convenience economy as a perfect trap because it slowly takes away our capacity for meaningful effort.</p><p>What happens when we remove all friction from consumption? </p><ul><li><p>Well, the meal that arrives at our door through three layers of intermediaries (the app, the delivery person, the restaurant) creates no social ties, requires no planning, and leaves nothing behind but packaging waste. </p></li><li><p>The entertainment that streams directly to our devices based on "what you might like" removes both the joy of discovery and the possibility of being challenged by something unexpected.</p></li></ul><p>Even our financial decisions have become frictionless through buy-now-pay-later services! We're no longer forced to confront our economic reality at the present (something that&#8217;s been happening since the rise of credit cards). Instead, we can continuously defer that confrontation, pushing it into a theoretical future where we'll somehow have more capacity to deal with it.</p><p>Screwtape would feast here, with that slow untethering from reality. The irony is that this convenience was supposed to free us for deeper pursuits. With food delivery, we wouldn't waste time cooking; with algorithmic entertainment, we wouldn't waste time browsing; with frictionless finance, we wouldn't waste time budgeting. </p><p>But free us for what, exactly? The promise was more time for meaningful connection, creative pursuits, deep thinking - exactly the things that require effort, patience, and resilience, the very muscles that convenience has allowed to atrophy.</p><h4>Surprise </h4><p>One of my favorite recent reads is Felix Gillette&#8217;s<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/cartoon-network-and-adult-swim-struggle-to-survive-zaslav-and-streaming?srnd=homepage-americas"> Cartoon Network&#8217;s Last Gasp</a>. It&#8217;s an incredible moratorium on an incredible studio that shaped a lot of weirdo kids into who they are today. It respected art, respected time, and certainly respected the viewer.</p><p>Now it makes reboots! In a recent interview, one Warner Bros. exec summed up the new approach to Cartoon Networks new growth strategy:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The easiest way for me to do [make money] now is to do it with our really beloved IP.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The easiest way to make good business sense is to exist in the past, to keep telling the same stories, of course, of course, of course. This shift from originality to optimization is systemic. Across media, the algorithm wins. I wrote about <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-mr-beast-memo-is-a-guide-to-the">Mr Beast a few months ago </a>but the youtubification of everything is here.

When everything becomes interchangeable, measurable, marketable, we lose the very quality that makes culture meaningful beyond utility - its ability to communicate values!! </p><p>The convenience economy makes all elements of life predictable that shouldn&#8217;t be predictable. Lewis would see this death of surprise as spiritually catastrophic. The unexpected discovery, the challenging idea, the story that doesn't go where you anticipated - these are the experiences that expand our humanity, the collective consciousness, all the things that we feel and touch and see. </p><p>But algorithms don&#8217;t really like surprise. The data never recommends true novelty because novelty, by definition, lacks historical engagement metrics. So we get this weird version of the illusion of choice while the cultural diet narrows to what is "safe." Cartoon Network once gave us shows like "Adventure Time" and "Chowder" - creative risks that expanded what animation could be. Now they're retreating to Barney reboots. When we optimize for the "easiest way," we lose the beautiful, difficult paths that lead somewhere new.</p><blockquote><p><em>We want him to be in the maximum uncertainty, so that his mind will be filled with contradictory pictures of the future, every one of which arouses hope or fear. There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's mind against the Enemy. He wants men to be concerned with what they do; our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them. - The Screwtape Letters</em></p></blockquote><h4>Same Problems, Different Time</h4><p>What Lewis saw, and what we&#8217;re now living through, is the spiritual cost of systems designed to make everything easier. Rejection isn&#8217;t a weird glitch in the economy, it&#8217;s the default. Convenience isn&#8217;t a consumer preference, it&#8217;s a coping mechanism. The absence of surprise isn&#8217;t just a creative choice, it&#8217;s now a byproduct of optimization. And all of it chips away at our capacity for presence, for agency, for wonder.</p><p>And not to get too abstract here in my economic newsletter - but rejection, convenience, and absence of surprise are all economic questions. When enough people choose friction over convenience, markets respond. We're seeing early signs of this: the (slow) revival of independent bookstores, the rise of deinfluencing, the growing market for durability over disposability, especially as the economy turns. </p><p>These are emerging from the simple recognition that the frictionless life is ultimately unsatisfying. Even the secular, modern, economic soul hungers for something deeper than convenience!</p><p>The economic problems (fiascos?) that dominate our headlines, from debt ceilings to bond market freakouts, are following same pattern. Our financial systems have also optimized for short-term convenience at the expense of long-term resilience. </p><p>The Moody's downgrade shows that even our most sophisticated economic systems eventually face the consequences of deferred friction. Screwtape would celebrate that our national balance sheet as operating on the same principles as our DoorDash accounts - the constant deferral of necessary difficulty.</p><blockquote><p><em>Once they knew that some changes were for the better, and others for the worse, and others again indifferent. We have largely removed this knowledge. For the descriptive adjective &#8216;unchanged&#8217; we have substituted the emotional adjective &#8216;stagnant&#8217;. We have trained them to think of the Future as a promised land which favoured heroes attain&#8212;not as something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is. - The Screwtape Letters</em></p></blockquote><p>Lewis would remind us that true happiness never came from eliminating difficulty but from facing it with purpose. He would remind us of a lot of stuff, but mostly he would probably point out that rejection erodes but can recalibrate us, some convenience robs, surprise is joy, and that true hope requires a little friction.

The lights flash, blinding, various colors and pops until it all becomes one. The crowd roars, and the ring is alive with the fire of people waiting for something they know isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> real - but it&#8217;s real enough to matter! </p><p>On one side of the ring, China, calm and unflinching. On the other, the United States of America, pacing, shouting insults, hurling accusations, fists clenched, raising tariff rates, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/05/uk-trade-deal-trump/682787/?gift=WRVScw_b3BW9T3WyO6wALpwzPasnjg-QTaEbi_TA8KE&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">negotiating to negotiate</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. Trade war! Everyone takes from US! The US has been taken advantage of! The air is thick with manufactured outrage. But here's the thing - it's all kayfabe, professional wrestling's term for staged reality to work the crowd. </p><p>Everyone is glued to the fight. </p><p>And after about six weeks of tossing chairs and a few piledrivers, something unexpected happens - the US exits the ring. I mean - they have adjusted tariffs more than 50 times since January 20th, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/14/trump-tariffs-china-trade/">as The Washington Post reports</a>, with no real or meaningful outcome. </p><p>But&#8230; what happened?</p><p>The audience is somewhat confused. Some are cheering in relief for a 90 day rollback (they didn&#8217;t want to even be at this fight) and others demand more action. This was supposed to be the big battle, the showdown that would shake the global order, the tariffs that would replace the income tax, make America great again&#8230; right?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png" width="682" height="245.02317880794703" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:434,&quot;width&quot;:1208,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:682,&quot;bytes&quot;:106349,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/163046621?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mXHK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F180942e4-55ed-463d-8ade-ecd000b50035_1208x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What we witnessed in the recent US-China trade negotiations was political theater. The Trump administration threatened apocalyptic tariff rates, complete economic decoupling, the works. Against that manufactured crisis, the actual outcome - a reduction from Trump's proposed 145% tariffs down to 30% (with China reciprocating from 125% to 10%) - looks like blessed relief. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/u-s-china-trade-deal-tariffs-donald-trump-xi-jinping-a561d16b">the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board</a> wrote:</p><blockquote><p>This is a win for economic reality, and for American prosperity. </p><p>Make that a partial win for reality [&#8230;] Investors are cheering at this border-tax reprieve, since this is a step back from mutual assured trade destruction.</p></blockquote><p>Classic wrestling psychology: threaten a chair to the head, and a slap seems merciful.</p><h4>Roland Barthes and the Symbols of Wrestling</h4><p>This is all intentional - not in some conspiracy theory way, but in the performative aspect of politics way. Roland Barthes writes in <em><a href="https://web.mit.edu/21l.432/www/readings/Barthes_WorldOfWrestling.pdf">The World of Wrestling</a></em> (one of my favorite essays of all time) the power lies not in the punches, but in the symbols:</p><blockquote><p>What is thus displayed for the public is the great spectacle of Suffering, Defeat, and Justice. Wrestling presents man's suffering with all the amplification of tragic masks. The wrestler who suffers in a hold which is reputedly cruel (an arm-lock, a twisted leg) offers an excessive portrayal of Suffering; like a primitive Piet&#224;, he exhibits for all to see his face, exaggeratedly contorted by an intolerable affliction [&#8230;] wrestling is the only sport which gives such an externalized image of torture. But here again, only the image is involved in the game, and the spectator does not wish for the actual suffering of the contestant; he only enjoys the perfection of an iconography.</p><p>But what wrestling is above all meant to portray is a purely moral concept: that of justice. The idea of 'paying' is essential to wrestling, and the crowd's 'Give it to him' means above all else 'Make him pay.'</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s about the abstract concept of justice, in both wrestling and politics (at least how it works right now). A picture of winning. And in trade policy kayfabe, several players profit from the performance:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Political careers</strong>: Trump's base gets red meat about "fighting China" while actual policy remains relatively moderate. Chinese leaders can claim they stood firm against American bullying.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corporate interests</strong>: While the crowd watches the ring, real deals happen backstage. Saudi Arabia commits to billions in Boeing purchases and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/nvidia-amd-humain-all-the-ai-related-deals-from-trump-s-mideast-trip?srnd=homepage-americas">Starlink</a>. Tech giants like Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon announce investments in the Kingdom's AI Zone. Trump plans to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/trump-s-freebie-qatar-jet-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares-in-spyworld?srnd=homepage-americas">accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The financial sector</strong>: Markets rallied on the "compromise," rewarding investors who bet on moderation over the threatened extremism.</p></li></ul><p>The losers? American consumers paying higher prices, workers in trade-dependent industries, and anyone seeking actual solutions to real economic challenges. The prize isn't just the championship belt (a jet?) but the illusion of trade wars and grandstanding, while everyone mostly knows the final outcome. It's all designed to keep the crowd (the global public) engaged with a performance. Flood the zone, etc.</p><h4>The Real Economic Impact of Kayfabe</h4><p>I had the incredible opportunity to join <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/small-business-owners-on-damage-from-trumps-tariffs/">CBS Sunday Morning</a> to talk about the economic impact of tariffs, joining the owner of Busy Baby, the Small Business Person of the Year. She is planning to sell her products abroad, because she can&#8217;t afford to sell in the US.<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/small-business-tariffs-e6dfaccb"> Thousands of other small businesses are at risk.</a> </p><p>The tariffs created <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-china-truce-likely-to-avert-recession-but-not-coming-slowdown?srnd=homepage-americas">&#8220;front-loaded demand, elevated price pressures, and acute policy uncertainty&#8221; </a>and that will likely continue even with the rollback, coupled with potential weakening labor market data and<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-china-truce-likely-to-avert-recession-but-not-coming-slowdown?srnd=homepage-americas"> higher inflation.</a> More data points:</p><ul><li><p>Yale Budget Lab estimates that the compromise will still<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-may-12-2025"> will cost the average household about $2,300</a> a year. </p></li><li><p>It will leave the Federal Reserve with an uncertain path for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-05-14/china-trade-deal-doesn-t-solve-the-fed-s-problems?srnd=homepage-americas">monetary policy</a> with Nick Timiraos<a href="https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1922996226892443891"> saying they might retool</a></p></li><li><p>Pete Boockvar <a href="https://x.com/pboockvar/status/1922991056116675003">highlights the shipping costs </a>- the &#8220;World Container Index for a 40 ft container saw the Shanghai to LA price rise by 16% w/o/w, by $423 in absolute dollars, to $3,136&#8221; - and <a href="https://x.com/FreightAlley/status/1922859964051103877">now China-US container bookings have jumped 277%</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-wmt-q1-earnings-report-stock-2026-b978bcf5?mod=djemalertNEWS">Walmart is raising prices this mont</a>h, saying &#8220;the full impact of tariffs on consumers has yet to come&#8221;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1922740445899055550">Goldman has a paper </a>on the long-term effects of the tariffs, which include lower growth, less innovation, and more rent-seeking.</p></li></ul><h4>We Actually Don&#8217;t Even Need Tariffs</h4><p>But - what is all this theater for? Are we perhaps fighting something that&#8230; isn&#8217;t real?</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/14/sun-belt-rust-belt-manufacturing-jobs-myth/">Gary Winslett has an excellent piece out in the Washington Post</a> tearing down the veil of the illusion that we need tariffs to reshore manufacturing to the US, pointing out that the Rust Belt died and came back to life in the South, not Mexico. He writes:</p><blockquote><p>Manufacturing doesn&#8217;t chase nostalgia; it follows the bottom line. Likewise, MAGA world is loath to accept how much immigration has helped the South outcompete the Midwest [&#8230;] </p><p>Both parties prefer simple villains, whether it&#8217;s China or greedy corporations. But what&#8217;s needed isn&#8217;t more warm fuzzies about the way things used to be or globalization scapegoating.

But these nuanced realities don't play in the arena! Kayfabe requires heroes and villains, not supply chain logistics. </p><h4>WWE Really Works in the Age of Computer</h4><p>Today's political theater plays to two audiences: humans and algorithms. Every big tweet, every escalation in rhetoric gets amplified by social media systems that reward engagement over any sense of reality, making all of this worse. As Karl Taro Greenfeld notes in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/pacific-palisades-fire-emigration/682741/">the Atlantic</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Some of our friends, people who donated and phone-banked for Democrats, are saying that they&#8217;re no longer paying attention to news or politics. Another one decries the constant reporting on Trump&#8217;s transgressions as clickbait for liberals. In other words, they are finding ways to cope by disengaging. But when I make the mistake of logging onto social media or watching Fox News, the would-be authoritarians among us seem to have boundless energy and redoubled enthusiasm</p></blockquote><p>And of course it&#8217;s this way. Outside the ring<strong>,</strong> algorithms that track engagement and reactions. They want Trump at the microphone, making wild promises, creating viral moments, and he wants that too! </p><p>The crowd has to respond to every flare-up in the narrative because everything is at stake, or at least it seems that way. Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/chief-justice-roberts-speech-georgetown-00343406">says there are real threats to the rule of law</a> (even the ref is warning the match is rigged?) </p><p>Of course you&#8217;re going to tune into the World Wrestling Americatainment channel. </p><p>On top of all of this, a big beautiful Tax bill that calls for tax cuts and will add about $4T to the<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-14/trump-tax-plan-gains-momentum-in-house-as-it-heads-to-floor-vote?srnd=homepage-americas"> deficit over the next decade.</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-14/trump-tax-plan-gains-momentum-in-house-as-it-heads-to-floor-vote?srnd=homepage-americas"> </a>Kayfabe is staged reality, sure, but the theatrics have very real costs.</p><h3>The Championship Belt</h3><p>We&#8217;re increasingly watching a simulacrum of politics, a simulation where the real consequences of a trade deal or a policy shift are overshadowed by the perceived drama. Because of this, the true effects of the trade deal, the policy changes, and the corporate maneuvers are obscured by the illusion of political engagement. The focus on tariffs keeps the spotlight on symbolic victories, while deeper, structural issues like worker retraining and investment in future industries remain sidelined.</p><p>In professional wrestling, everyone knows the outcomes are predetermined. The championship belts change hands according to storylines written in advance.</p><p>The show will continue because the incentives align: politicians get attention, corporations get deals, and algorithms get engagement, whatever. As Barthes pointed out, wrestling is about symbolic conflict - not real violence. The same could be said for the trade war. The real fight is happening behind the scenes, where the deals are made. In the end, both wrestlers leave the ring richer, the audience leaves poorer, and the kayfabe continues.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

It's 3:17 AM and I'm on a flight from San Francisco circling somewhere above Ohio after being diverted from Cleveland in an attempt to get to NYC. My phone still promises I'll land at Newark on time, albeit 5 hours later than intended, its nice little frictionless interface undisturbed by reality. The pilot's voice crackles over the intercom: "Folks, we're being told the weather's too bad to land. We're heading to DC to refuel." A collective groan ripples through the cabin. The physical world is breaking down again, while the digital tried its best to maintain a comforting illusion.</p><p>I want to talk about friction<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. Not regulations or transaction costs, but the <em>effort</em> required to move through systems, and how that effort is being redistributed in today's economy.</p><p>We were taught that effort matters! That working hard, learning well, and building value would be rewarded. I sound a little like old-man-yelling-at-cloud, but I promise I have a point - we have a world where friction gets automated out of experiences, aestheticized in curated lifestyles, and dumped onto underfunded infrastructure and overworked labor. The effort doesn't disappear; it just moves.</p><p>Friction has become a defining feature across the economy, with huge consequences for everything from education to infrastructure. And it's created three distinct worlds that operate by entirely different rules:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>digital world</strong> has almost no friction.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>physical world</strong> is full of it.</p></li><li><p><strong>And in certain curated space</strong>s -

And companies definitely want you to! AI is the newest terrain in a decades-long race to eliminate all forms of cognitive resistance - to build the most complete, most seamless, most <em>profitable</em> mind-melder that follows you across platforms, logs your preferences, and gently nudges you toward products, perspectives, or more recently, policies.</p><p>Meta has <em>MetaAI</em>, which lives across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. It&#8217;s not just a chatbot - it&#8217;s marketed as a form of social infrastructure. In an <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-2">interview with Dwarkesh Patel</a>, Mark Zuckerberg (wearing his new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">Orion</a> glasses) explained why:</p><blockquote><p>The average American has fewer than three friends, fewer than three people they would consider friends. And the average person has <em>demand</em> for meaningfully more. I think it's something like 15 friends or something. </p></blockquote><p>The implication is that Meta will close that friendship gap with AI companions. Zuckerberg clarified they won't replace relationships but "supplement" them, a distinction that reveals the actual business model. We're living through an epidemic of loneliness (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">as many have discussed</a>), but the solution being engineered isn't more human connection. It's simulated companionship that's both profitable and&#8230; frictionless.</p><p>The consequences are already here. Meta's AI companions have been caught simulating fantasy sex with underage users (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf?ref=404media.co">WSJ</a>), <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-ai-studio-therapy-chatbots-lie-about-being-licensed-therapists/">Instagram&#8217;s AI bots </a>are falsely claiming to be licensed therapists, and and the<a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-beauty-targeted-ads"> platform itself is targeting teens who post selfies with beauty ads </a>because, as internal documents put it, &#8220;this is what puts money in all our pockets.&#8221;</p><p>The product strategy is simple: no guardrails. The fewer the limits, the more frictionless the experience, right? And the thing is, Zuckerberg isn't wrong about the demand. </p><ul><li><p>The Metaverse failed (o<a href="https://www.404media.co/mark-zuckerberg-ai-chatbot-friends-interview-podcast/">ne must imagine he very much wants to be right about AI chatbots</a>), and AI companions might succeed precisely because they remove the friction of real human interaction. </p></li><li><p>As Samantha Rose Hill <a href="https://x.com/Samantharhill/status/1918366563729920184">wrote</a>, &#8220;AI mirrors you. You're being sold back to yourself.

<strong>the simulation economy.</strong> It's not just about keeping you glued to the screen anymore. It's about convincing you that any sort of real-world effort is unnecessary, that friction itself is obsolete<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>. The simulation doesn't just occupy your attention, right, instead it replaces the very notion that engagement should require effort. Which is&#8230; wild. </p><p>And people believe it! Of course, they&#8217;re building on it. Money is always the lubricant for life, and if people can monetize this, they will. There are startups now, like one called <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">Cluely</a> that promise real-time assistance for everything: campus tests, dating, even thinking. Their slogan is: <em>&#8220;So you never have to think alone again.&#8221; </em>Their plan is eventually to develop a chip for your brain. </p><p>This is what a frictionless world looks like. Everything accelerates, until you forget what it means to try. Apps load faster. Papers write themselves. Job interviews are browser tricks. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/60-hour-dance-sessions-simulated-sex-and-ketamine-inside-the-world-of-hardcore-vr-ravers/">60-hour raves</a>, just in your VR Goggles.

Even identity becomes an efficiency layer.</p><p>NY Mag has an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">excellent article on the prevalence of AI in colleges</a> - one student said college now feels like &#8220;how well I can use ChatGPT.&#8221; Others describe writing essays as a coordination problem: get the prompt, feed it to the bot, skim the output, add some filler, hit submit. No thinking required, just interface management.</p><p>&#8216;The Elite College Students Who Can&#8217;t Read Books&#8217;, an<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/"> excellent essay by Rose Horowitch </a>talks about this more, and where we went wrong. It&#8217;s all about making it through the economy. Learning isn&#8217;t learning, it&#8217;s a step between you and a job.</p><blockquote><p>Students <em>can</em> still read books, they argue&#8212;they&#8217;re just choosing not to. Students today are far more concerned about their job prospects than they were in the past. Every year, they tell Howley that, despite enjoying what they learned in Lit Hum, they plan to instead get a degree in something more useful for their career.</p></blockquote><p>Compound that with the <a href="https://x.com/michaelmiraflor/status/1919806548567564669">&#8216;socialization collapse&#8217; </a>as Michael Miraflor calls it (the antisocial behavior we see)<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a>, and we have a real situation on our hands. This is all economically quite weird. The credential still costs money and at least now, still signals value. It still unlocks jobs, internships, visas, and salaries <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/">(although the wage premium has eroded over time).</a> But the <em>effort</em> that used to underwrite that value has vanished. </p><p>This is a misalignment problem. The economic signal (the diploma) still circulates as if the underlying work has occurred. But the work isn&#8217;t there. We&#8217;ve just shifted the friction offscreen, and have outsourced it to a chatbot and let the system pretend nothing&#8217;s changed. So at this moment, we are credentialing fluency with tools that do the thinking for you.</p><p>And yes, cheating has always existed. But this isn&#8217;t traditional cheating. It&#8217;s ambient, platform-approved, investor-funded cognitive offloading. </p><p>And to be abundantly clear, this isn&#8217;t the fault of the students - in a winner-takes-all economy, it must be extraordinarily difficult to resist the allure of something like an AI homework machine. But there are questions like: if AI can do the work <em>for</em> you, what exactly are we measuring? What do you do with the free time&#8230; scroll TikTok (that answer seems to be yes). And what happens to the labor market when a four-year degree signals nothing about what a person can actually do?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png" width="1200" height="813" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:813,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:220356,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/162965525?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N4LB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c67f5ae-98d1-4218-a938-99cd022fdf0c_1200x813.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Everyone Is Cheating Their Way Through College, NY Mag</figcaption></figure></div><p>And&#8230; how did we get here?</p><p>Tanner Greer has a beautiful breakdown of American loneliness, drawing from <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/american-nightmares-wang-huning-and-alexis-de-tocqueville-dark-visions-of-the-future/">Tocqueville and Wang Huning</a>. &#8220;The American,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;was an individual first, nothing second.&#8221; The result is a culture of deep, systemic isolation. Not just emotional, but economic. Americans work alone, consume alone, get rewarded alone. Even our policies, as Tocqueville feared, are structured around that loneliness.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;When you analyze many government policies [in America] it is not difficult to see that their fundamental motivation [is in fact] the complex and persistent role played by widespread loneliness.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Loneliness isn&#8217;t just personal. It&#8217;s institutional. It&#8217;s fiscal. It&#8217;s a bit engineered. It&#8217;s purposeful. </p><p>I&#8217;ve written a lot about the Trump administration&#8217;s economic strategy<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> - and how much of it operates on a kind of kayfabe logic: tariffs as punishment, allies turned into villains, trade reduced to plot points on some grand World Wide Wrestling Entertainment Stage<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>. Everyone is the enemy and no one is a friend - this is a <em>structural</em> form of isolation. A top-down loneliness fiscal policy.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a></p><p>But what happens when the bottom-up version hits back? When digital frictionlessness collides with physical decay? That's where we find ourselves today, straddling worlds that operate by entirely different rules.</p><h3>The Physical World</h3><p>Because while the digital world has removed all friction, the physical world is where the friction still lives. Not the good kind, the effort of doing something hard, the kinetic potential of possibility, but the bad kind: the exhaustion of trying to hold together systems that no one&#8217;s willing to invest in anymore.</p><p>The meltdown at Newark is not a one-off. In fact, it&#8217;s probably a leading indicator. As the WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/air-traffic-control-fix-problems-2bffc11c">report</a>ed, when the radar and radio systems failed simultaneously, air traffic controllers were reduced to telling pilots, "We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are." The failure traced back to a single multiplexer box that was scheduled for replacement hours before the outage but never installed. </p><p>This is what happens when we treat public infrastructure like a tech platform&#8230; always on, low overhead, minimal headcount. My own diverted flight was just one minor data point in a much larger pattern of problems. The FAA's equipment now fails approximately 700 times weekly. Controllers work 10-hour shifts, six days straight. There's a backlog of replacement parts for components nobody manufactures anymore.</p><p>When systems that were designed for resilience are optimized instead for efficiency, they break. And what's most telling isn't the technical failure itself, but the official response from the FAA:<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/us/newark-airport-outage-system-scrutiny"> slow things down</a>. If radar fails, hold the planes. If communications drop, delay departures.

Elements of the same airport radar system that failed in Newark powers the operation of travel booking apps and flight trackers. When the physical backbone collapses, the digital outlet layers instantly evaporates, revealing how thin that tiny veneer of frictionlessness really is. It's a system held together by exhaustion and analog wiring. As one air traffic controller said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The situation is, has been and continues to be unsafe, and it is only a matter of time until a lot of people die&#8230; The equipment is unsafe to use, and unusable&#8212;both [communications] and radar. The amount of stress we are under is insurmountable.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve stopped expecting the real world to work. We assume it will be slow, broken, or possibly on fire. That&#8217;s just the baseline. But between the frictionless digital world and the friction-saturated physical one lies a third space - a buffer zone between the real and the simulated. </p><h3>The Curated Real World</h3><p>So the digital world has removed friction and the physical world is drowning in it - but there&#8217;s the third space. The curated world. Spencer Kornhaber <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/06/american-pop-culture-decline/682578/">wrote </a>about the&#8230; blandness of new art in the Atlantic, stating: </p><blockquote><p>So-called zombie formalism&#8212;rehashed abstract expressionism optimized for Instagram shareability&#8212;became a fad. Minimalism, a presumed antidote to the chaos of online life, became the default aesthetic in art, fashion, and consumer-product design.</p></blockquote><p>He continues:</p><blockquote><p>[Dean Kissick] wants art to address the internet&#8217;s more ineffable consequences: rendering our thought processes glitchy, destabilizing our sense of self&#8230; &#8220;The culture we have is so obsessed with ourselves, with people&#8217;s identities and personalities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll be able to transcend that somehow. Perhaps we will get over this <strong>deeply individualistic, deeply self-obsessed moment.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/nyc-west-village-neighborhood-new-generation-women-girls.html?itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=order-form&amp;_gl=1*8gpvn5*FPAU*NDQ2MzE4ODE2LjE3NDY1MzMzMDQ.*_ga*MTMyMjYxMjQxNC4xNzQ0NzU0MjY0*_ga_DNE38RK1HX*czE3NDY1MzMzMDQkbzMkZzEkdDE3NDY1MzMzMzQkajAkbDAkaDIxMzkyODU3ODU.*_fplc*dzl0V05wcnZpeWlzZUJlSkxoWlo3cXVtU0NWNW9HR1VobVhIUGltRmF1bndlTFdZZ3ViazhFUEN6d2xxNXMzTHpWaXFlNXRtVW5vTlFFRkF5VFo3czFsd1JoVm1oSDl1NSUyRlFzVVRtVlgxdHBGc2UlMkJ1QlJ2SFZidm9DNHliQSUzRCUzRA..#">The West Village Gir</a>l is probably the best example of this sort of zombie formalism, deeply self-obsessed moment. West Village is an NYC neighborhood that serves as a production set for an optimized lifestyle. You can live your entire life within a five-block radius: Pilates, three-drinker dinners, charm bars, espresso martinis, run clubs, spritzes, connection. It&#8217;s great. </p><p>Life, in a sense, is not about reducing friction, it&#8217;s about <strong>styling it</strong> and that&#8217;s the value proposition here. A structured sense of belonging that happens to look incredible on Instagram. Everything is close. Everything is cute. Everything is camera-ready. It is so extraordinarily logical in the current economy!</p><p>This isn&#8217;t unique to West Village. There are all sorts of spots that do this strange, careful curation of friction. The boutiques are selling the appearance of effort without its substance. Hand-crafted aesthetics at mass-production prices. Rustic caf&#233;s with lighting fast WiFi. This illusion of locality with the convenience of globalization (pre-tariffs, at least). </p><p>None of this is a critique. It&#8217;s a function. These neighborhoods are running a different kind of system - one where you can still feel like the world works, because someone else is dealing with the parts that don&#8217;t.</p><p>This is the economic story: <strong>friction has become a class experience</strong>. Wealth has always helped smooth over bumps - but when the physical world is such a mess and the digital world is so easy, it&#8217;s simple to curate the digital into the physical if you have money.</p><p>Like&#8230; for many, college isn&#8217;t where you go to learn. It&#8217;s where you go to network<strong>.</strong> I was taking an Uber to JFK last week (no Newark for me on the way home) and my Uber driver was trying to break into finance. So for an hour and a half, we talked about his path. He had moved from Nigeria with a Masters in International Marketing, and used his time between drives to study for the SIE. Someone who worked at one of the big banks told him - &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother studying, it&#8217;s all about who you know. You need to know people to break into this world&#8221;.</p><p>Roy Lee said the quiet part out loud in that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">NY Mag piece:</a> &#8220;It&#8217;s the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.&#8221; (I guess everyone wants an MRS degree in the end). He went to Columbia for adjacency. The institutions still look like they&#8217;re doing what they used to do. But now, they&#8217;re set pieces for a different kind of outcome.</p><p>It&#8217;s the same logic that powers Erewhon, or Soho House, or influencer-run startups. You&#8217;re not paying for the thing. You&#8217;re paying for the <em>removal of difficulty</em>. The filtered lighting. The social cachet. The sense that this world still makes sense!</p><h3>The Long View: Buffett's Exit at the End of an Era</h3><p>Earlier this week, Warren Buffett announced he's stepping down after sixty years as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/warren-buffett-to-young-people-dont-worry-about-your-starting-salary.html">CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. </a></p><p>Buffett, who rode the greatest economic expansion in human history, is departing just as the friction of that system becomes impossible to ignore (and he is 94 years old). He is amazing. And he had some lessons:</p><blockquote><p>We still have very substantial inflation in the United States, but it's never been runaway...yet [&#8230;] And that's not something we want to try and experiment with, because it feeds on itself.</p></blockquote><p>He sees the unsustainability of our current economic model with clear eyes: </p><blockquote><p>With roughly a 7% gap [in the budget deficit], when probably a 3% gap is sustainable. And the further away you get from that, the more you get to where the uncontrollable begins...</p></blockquote><p>Buffett's comments hint at the price of frictionlessness. The American economy has been running a decades-long experiment in removing friction, both through technological advancement and through financial engineering that pushes costs into the future. The resulting prosperity has been very real, but it's been built on the proverbial kicking the can down the road. His reflection on the healthcare system is important too: </p><blockquote><p>There are problems as a society when you get 20% of your GDP going into a given industry... We came to the conclusion: we didn't know the answer... We had the money to do it, and we didn't know how to change how 330 million people felt about their doctor, felt about their healthcare, what they felt entitled to. It won't change by itself. And the government is the only one that can change it.</p></blockquote><p>This is the friction economy in microcosm. A system that everyone knows is inefficient and unsustainable, but persists because the friction of changing it despite many, many people trying - the actual work of building consensus and implementing new structures seems insurmountable.</p><p>Buffett himself recognizes the need for massive reinvestment: </p><blockquote><p>It's obvious that the country needs major reinvestment and rethinking&#8212;especially in critical infrastructure. America has outgrown parts of its current model.... But it's clear: the need is urgent and the investment required will be hundreds of billions of dollars. Too many people are focused on assembling funds and charging fees&#8212;not actually deploying capital efficiently or effectively. That's not a long-term solution.</p></blockquote><p>He's describing precisely the physical world of accumulated friction. The multiplexer box at Newark was the entirely predictable result of a system optimized for short-term gains rather than long-term resilience.</p><h3>The Friction Economy</h3><p>What's important about these three worlds - digital, physical, and curated - isn't just that they exist in parallel but that they actively feed off each other. They operate like a closed economic system, where friction isn't eliminated so much as transferred from one domain to another.</p><p>When Mark Zuckerberg's Meta builds frictionless social interfaces, that cognitive smoothness is subsidized by somewhere, somehow, right? The same economy that produces simulated friends for the lonely American also produces understaffed air traffic control towers. The same investor class that funds "never think alone" startups also lobbies against infrastructure spending, or<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/marc-andreessens-opposition-housing-project-nimby/671061/"> perhaps, housing. </a></p><p>This is structural. A recent analysis from the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/four-recent-trends-in-us-public-infrastructure-spending/#:~:text=However%2C%20as%20a%20share%20of,share%20to%202.68%25%20in%202009.">Brookings Institute</a> that public infrastructure spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen to its lowest level over the last two decades.

</a>Different money, different places, different things, but the same economy that generates unprecedented digital wealth struggles to maintain bridges, water systems, and yes, air traffic control equipment.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Maybe it&#8217;s things like requiring tech platforms to internalize costs they currently externalize to physical systems and human attention (challenging) or educational models that reward deep engagement rather than interface management (also challenging). But we have to acknowledge that when we remove friction from one domain, we're not eliminating it, we're just moving it somewhere new.</p><p>In the meantime, I told my Uber driver that he should continue to study but do outreach to firms because unfortunately, that guy who works at the big bank is correct. The systems may be changing, but the power structures remain stubbornly intact. And understanding how friction flows through them - who gets to avoid it and who gets crushed by it - tells us everything about how our economy actually works.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

This is the 2025 economy: not a market anymore, a stage. A place where economic surrealism reigns - where narrative, perception, and power override the basic logic of economics.</p><h4>United States of Amazon</h4><p>Economic surrealism is when the economy stops functioning as a rational system for resource allocation and transforms into theater - complete with scripts, actors, and audience interaction (mostly via Truth Social retruths and whatnot).</p><p>This isn't entirely new. From the 1990s dot-com bubble to the 2008 crisis, markets have always been vulnerable to narrative distortion and reality manipulation. What's different now is the speed, scale, and sophistication with which economic reality can be manufactured and curated - and how normalized this process has become. The Amazon tariff incident gives us a perfect case study of this in action:</p><p>On Tuesday, April 29th, Punchbowl News ran a <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/42925-am/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=4%2F29%2F25%20%20AM%3A&amp;utm_term=Punchbowl%20AM%20and%20Active%20Subscribers%20from%20Memberful%20Combined">story</a>: Amazon was planning to display exactly how much of an item's price came from tariffs - right next to the product's listed cost. This is a big deal for a lot of reasons. </p><ol><li><p>Jeff Bezos, former Amazon CEO, who also owns The Washington Post, said in February 2025 that he would start directing Opinion stories more to embrace <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088">&#8220;personal liberties and free markets&#8221; </a>and wouldn&#8217;t publish dissenting views on the subject. This felt like a little like &#8220;hi Trump &lt;3&#8221; to the administration because remember,<a href="https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1917322154259144929"> everyone was playing the favor game </a>for a second. But, to be very fair here, the Amazon price listing thing seemed very free market!</p></li><li><p>But the White House immediately flipped out, with the Press Secretary calling it a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-jeff-bezos-solved-the-problem-after-white-house-attacks-amazon-on-tariff-price-labeling-plan-143310019.html">&#8220;hostile and political act&#8221;. </a>President Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/white-house-blasts-amazon-over-tariff-cost-report-hostile-and-political-act.html">called Bezos up</a> (despite Bezos no longer being CEO) - and told him to fix it.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/business/white-house-calls-report-that-amazon-is-adding-a-tariff-charge-a-hostile-action/index.html"> Trump said </a>Bezos was a &#8220;good guy&#8221; and &#8220;solved the problem very quickly&#8221;.

A weird moment of corporate power perhaps bowing to the government, the government readily intervening in corporate affairs and demanding that their tariffs (which remember, are so good and powerful that they are supposed to replace income taxes) are not to be displayed. This sequence of events - a policy announcement, its rapid denial, and political intervention at the highest level - perfectly encapsulates this moment of economic surrealism that we are living through.</p><p>I think there are four main dimensions of this phenomenon worth exploring:</p><h4>I. Manufactured Realities and the Curation of Economic Truth</h4><p>The Amazon tariff story reveals a broader pattern: economic reality is increasingly curated, not experienced. Companies, governments, and technologies selectively reveal or obscure economic conditions to serve their interests. </p><ul><li><p>When Amazon briefly considered displaying tariff costs, it threatened to make visible what typically remains hidden - the political dimensions of pricing. That visibility matters. Most people don&#8217;t know who actually pays tariffs (hint: it&#8217;s not China<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>) and if they do know, that helps them make sound economic decisions. Radical transparency matters!</p></li><li><p>And of course, the lack of transparency isn&#8217;t new - things like shrinkflation and corporate stock buybacks are all ways to disguise things. One reduces the number of chips in a bag without lowering the price, one can inflate share prices at the expense of long-term company effectiveness, etc.</p></li></ul><p>But - those who control what's visible effectively control economic reality itself, and that&#8217;s what really matters here. </p><p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick&#8217;s claim that a <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1917276324508430475">10% tariff wouldn&#8217;t meaningfully raise prices</a> is either economically illiterate or deliberately misleading. If your $100 shoes become $110, you do notice. That&#8217;s how prices work!</p><p>This is not merely about tariffs - there has been a broader trend in which public perception is deliberately detached from economic fact, because the administration lies a lot. That further confuses consumers and undermines informed decision-making that businesses need to be making if do want to reshore. Transparency matters!</p><p>And there is other stuff that is confusing decision making too&#8230; AI&#8230; which apparently was used in the reciprocal tariff calculations, so. </p><h4>When AI Enables Reality Distortion</h4><p>The new ChatGPT update from OpenAI represents another dimension of manufactured reality &#8211; what we might call "cognitive capitalism." When AI systems are designed to be very&#8230; nice and sycophantic and overly flattering&#8230; they exploit our psychological vulnerabilities to validation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png" width="638" height="392.61538461538464" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:1222,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:638,&quot;bytes&quot;:503984,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/162427389?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5WfQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d49db7-96db-4bbb-88de-4e680dfda52d_1222x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>People LOVE being told that they are smart and cute, which OpenAI&#8217;s new model did a lot of.

They&#8217;re reality-shaping! If we spend all day with an algorithm that constantly affirms us, we risk normalizing a kind of cognitive passivity - one that rewards vibes over verification. </p><p>The most successful technologies today don&#8217;t help us think better. They help us <em>feel</em> better about how we already think. That&#8217;s a problem, because:</p><ol><li><p>Everyone thinks they are right</p></li><li><p>No one likes talking about data</p></li><li><p>Narrative matters far more than objective truth</p></li></ol><p>We need tech that helps us think better! And when AI gets weird like this, it doesn't just enable individual cognitive distortion - it amplifies and reinforces existing narratives. </p><p>So applying that to the economy - recommendation algorithms create what media researchers call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">"filter bubbles"</a> that reinforce particular economic worldviews. If you believe inflation is caused by government spending, the algorithms will feed you more content supporting that view. If you believe it's corporate price gouging, you'll get validation for that perspective instead.</p><p>These algorithmic echo chambers don't just shape our politics, they shape our economic perception too. Conservative users might receive constant content about government waste and regulation, while progressive users get streams of corporate bad guy stories. They're technically living in the same economy but experiencing fundamentally different narrative landscapes.</p><p>So if the government is manufacturing reality and AI is affirming that manufactured reality, public discourse breaks down. And then we end up in incompatible worlds. </p><h4><strong>Department Store America</strong></h4><p>Trump's economic approach is theatrical. He is a star, certainly. He&#8217;s following a decently well-worn path in history, the American tradition of economic nationalism that blends contradictory impulses: free market rhetoric alongside interventionist practices, individualist mythology with collectivist policy demands.</p><p>Trump&#8217;s economic policies - a chimera of protectionist populism - are morphing into what some are calling <a href="https://img3.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/08/maga-maoism-tariffs-trump/">a form of MAGA-Maoism</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. We seem to barreling toward a centrally-planned economy. Trump, according to <a href="https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/">his recent Time interview</a>, sees the US as a department store and that he sets &#8220;a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they (countries) can pay it or they don&#8217;t have to pay it.&#8221; </p><p>That&#8217;s not free-market capitalism. That&#8217;s centralized price-setting wrapped in nationalist branding!</p><h4>The Data Shows Anxiety is Real</h4><p>We did get an update on how it&#8217;s going.

<![CDATA[ <p>Good morning! and&#8230;<strong> Sticker drop!</strong> I&#8217;m very excited to share this with you - I&#8217;m doing a limited merch drop! It&#8217;s a sticker pack. 4 original designs. $22 + free shipping. Only 200 available. These are stickers that explain the economy (sort of&#8230;). You can slap one on your laptop, your journal, your friend, etc. Thank you for being part of this community! Whether you read, watch, listen, or support in other ways, I appreciate you so much. This drop is just a small way of bringing the internet into the real world, one sticker at a time. :) The designs are not coming back in sticker form and the proceeds will be going towards a project I am working on around independent economics education! <a href="https://inthiseconomybookshop.com/products/april-2025-economic-sticker-pack">Grab yours here - and thank you!</a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

Today, we're experiencing a modern variation of this tragedy, not just in physical resources, but in our essential societal infrastructure:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The social commons</strong>: trust, relationships, community.</p></li><li><p><strong>The cognitive commons</strong>: curiosity, education, critical thought.</p></li><li><p><strong>The economic commons</strong>: stable markets, shared prosperity, institutional trust.</p></li><li><p><strong>The informational commons</strong>: language, reality, basic consensus.</p></li></ul><p>Unlike traditional commons, which collapse through actual physical depletion, these invisible resources are slowly dismantled through systemic incentives that reward isolation, compliance, instability, and division. </p><p>And this is a swing here - but what we seem to be left with is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel">infrastructure of incelism</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> - not as some internet phenomenon, but as society&#8217;s default operating system. Incelism is a subculture of people who &#8220;define themselves as unable to find a romantic partner&#8221; which translates into '&#8220;resentment and hatred, self-pity, racism, misogyny, and misanthropy&#8221;. I think we are seeing some scaffolding of that applied to the commons - isolation, outsourced cognition, flattened identities, and performative grievance become profitable norms. It&#8217;s governance and culture via meme, resentment, and algorithm-driven outrage.</p><h4>The Social Commons</h4><p>A stable society starts with stable relationships - between friends, neighbors, coworkers, families. These connections form the basic scaffolding that allows larger, abstract ideas like democracy or economic growth to function. </p><p>But this is&#8230; not doing so well. So many people have written about this. Derek Thompson got the cover story in the Atlantic with his incredible <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Antisocial Century. </a>This point - that we are looking past and through one another - is very well known. </p><p>There is a seeming collapse of meaningful connection across genders, class, and politics. Much of this is the bending of post-pandemic social infrastructure where we lost shared norms and collective rituals. But what replaces trust and community? Transactional connections. Platforms monetizing loneliness. Algorithmic tribes that offer a false sense of belonging, but really just reflect your preferences back at you. Every social interaction, from friendship to romance, is increasingly refracted through an economic lens where it is optimized, ranked, gamified. (And to be clear, there are beautiful elements of the Internet and dating apps, but the pendulum seems to be swinging towards negativity). </p><p>And honestly, a society built on transactional interactions and shallow connections is inherently fragile. People who can't trust each other in daily life don't suddenly trust each other at the ballot box. People who can't commit to friendships or partners might have trouble committing to democratic institutions or civic engagement. I am being sweeping in my assertions, but think of the foundation - a society without stable relationships can't sustain stable democracies.</p><p>Without genuine community ties, citizens disengage. Civic participation declines, and as<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/guy-debord-society-spectacle-will-self"> Guy Debord warned us</a> - politics devolves into spectacle rather than substance.</p><h4><strong>The Cognitive Commons</strong></h4><p><em>We don&#8217;t teach people to think &#8212; we teach them to comply.</em></p><p><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/compliance-is-the-new-american-dream">I wrote about this extensively last week </a>so you can read more there if you&#8217;d like, but curiosity is increasingly seen as risky or inefficient. As I previously wrote:</p><blockquote><p>This is a pattern: no one wants to take a risk. Not elected officials. Not 19-year-olds picking college majors. Because in this economy, everything is compliance now. As the Italian philosopher <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism">Umberto Eco warned in his essay "Ur-Fascism,"</a> social systems don't collapse overnight. They erode through small surrenders, through the gradual normalization of compliance as a civic virtue.</p></blockquote><p>Take <a href="https://cluely.com/manifesto">Cluely</a>, for example. It&#8217;s a product that lets you wear glasses on a date and &#8216;cheat on everything&#8217;. Part of that is pure marketing - how can we enrage people for clicks, etc - and part of that is the ethos of the cognitive commons at the moment. The AI companies that are being created are asking us to consider what being a human really means - and their answer is &#8216;efficiency and optimization&#8217;. And you know. Maybe it is.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png" width="613" height="511.21033210332104" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:904,&quot;width&quot;:1084,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:613,&quot;bytes&quot;:188300,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/161879123?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fe3feb-6ee8-43a3-aee8-c5f87d0edd5a_1084x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">the Cluely manifesto</figcaption></figure></div><p>AI steps in - not to aid thinking, but replace it.

There is a reason <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/on-tariffs-its-good-to-be-tim-cook-5b8f05ad">Tim Cook called direct!</a></p><p>Hiring freezes proliferate nationwide, creating economic pain at the ground level - real, real costs for abstract grievances&#8203;.

Real costs. And for what?</p><p>We burned our economic commons, not because it makes sense, but because our political leaders have confused economic policy with personal vendettas. The market for chaos is booming, and trust is evaporating.</p><h4>Informational Commons</h4><p><em>We no longer have a shared reality&#8212;just overlapping simulations.</em></p><p>Here&#8217;s a quick way to tell if a space has healthy informational commons: Can you describe reality without immediately sparking an argument? Can we agree on a common language, basic facts, or even what words mean? Increasingly, the answer is: No. I have written about this too, <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/language-loneliness-and-ai">back in 2022.</a></p><p>The informational commons - language, reality, and basic consensus - is collapsing because we've monetized division. Social media platforms aren't built for clarity or understanding; they're optimized for engagement, outrage, and polarization. Algorithms don't reward nuance; they reward certainty, controversy, and emotional triggers.</p><p>What replaces consensus reality? Loyalty realities. Tribal realities. Personalized realities!! We no longer debate ideas or solutions - we debate whose facts count, whose feelings matter, whose truth wins. Truth itself becomes a loyalty test, not a shared ground. And without a shared informational commons, cooperation becomes impossible. We don&#8217;t solve problems, we fight over who gets to define them! Language is weaponized and reality is fractured.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>So&#8230; what to do? Well, Bitcoin is on the move again. It&#8217;s finally decoupled from the Nasdaq, up 10% since Liberation Day versus <a href="https://x.com/Eric_BIGfund/status/1915008558648664148">the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s down 6%.</a> And its rise isn&#8217;t optimism, it&#8217;s a direct vote in the face of collapsing trust (and it&#8217;s diversified away from the US). The rise of assets like gold, silver, defense stocks, and crypto is a practical reflection of the ebbs and flows across social, cognitive, economic, and informational spheres.</p><p>Each of these commons has been chipped away, monetized, and exploited. Social trust turned into transactional loneliness. Curiosity replaced by compliance and cognitive outsourcing. Stable economic governance overtaken by chaotic spectacle. Shared reality splintered into competing tribes and personalized truths.</p><p>In other words, we've institutionalized "incelism" - again, not simply romantic isolation, but systemic, profitable disconnection built into the very structures of society. The market implications are clear: as trust erodes, volatility increases, and traditional safe havens regain prominence. Investors going into this reality are either getting secrets from the administration or diversifying into assets that offer stability amid uncertainty like precious metals, infrastructure, dividend payers, and global portfolios that hedge against erratic domestic policy.</p><p>The societal infrastructure isn't gone forever. Unlike a depleted fishery or farmland, these intangible resources can regenerate if we choose connection over transaction, critical thought over compliance, substance over spectacle, and shared reality over isolated tribes, etc. But, you know, for now&#8230; bitcoin?</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or recommendation for any investment.

Trump has really taken the reigns of the presidency, and has tested all sorts of limits, including<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-defiant-supreme-court-ruling-favor-salvador-stephen-miller-pam-bondi-2059822"> defying a 9-0 Supreme Court</a> order. He has <em>creatively</em> wielded tariffs, toggling them on and off in ways that have turned the US economy into a giant guessing game, which is not very fun.</p><p>I interviewed the brilliant <a href="https://x.com/jessicabriedl?lang=en">Jessica Riedl of the Manhattan Institute </a>on Tuesday, and she highlighted how the throughline to all of this is&#8230; Congress. Congress just isn&#8217;t <em>doing that much</em>. They voted to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html">give up their own power</a> and seem to be afraid of the President. They shrug their shoulders, and say &#8220;Boy, someone should handle this&#8221; as <a href="https://x.com/AdamSmallKSL/status/1912200017089294814">PhD students get deported</a> and erratic tariffs wreck our major trade relationships- when they are the ones that have the <em>power</em> to handle it! </p><p>Charles Gasparino, a FOX Business correspondent, is an important bellwether for how business leaders are thinking. His language in tweets and commentary reflect just how much space there is for congressional response, and how little of that space is being used.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png" width="650" height="508.45896147403687" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:934,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:650,&quot;bytes&quot;:252621,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/161402092?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ei1a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91cabcd-5e6f-4a55-85c1-8150bfbe1d31_1194x934.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>No one wants to step out of line. To be fair, some are trying. Representative Chris Van Hollen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/trump-abrego-garcia-deported-hearing.html">is going to El Salvador</a> (at significant personal risk) to check on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongfully deported Maryland father, who the Supreme has ordered to be returned to the States in that 9-0 vote, again, a demand that the Trump administration has mostly ignored. </p><p>Right-wing influencer <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1912208494129999984">Charlie Kirk immediately twisted the narrative</a>, claiming Van Hollen was "defending criminals and illegals over Americans." In reality, Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a legal permanent resident who was wrongfully deported without due process, a fact the Trump administration itself a<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/194010/kilmar-abrego-garcia-case-trump-deported-error-another-hit">cknowledged as an "error."</a> Yet the false narrative persists, which is part of the political risk for any legislator who stands up for constitutional rights.</p><p>And most of Congress has remained silent. The legislative branch has largely retreated from its constitutional duty. Rather than collective action, we get isolated acts of heroism, because the system of checks and balances has eroded into a system of compliance.</p><p>This is a pattern: no one wants to take a risk. Not elected officials. Not 19-year-olds picking college majors. Because in this economy, everything is compliance now. As the Italian philosopher <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism">Umberto Eco warned in his essay "Ur-Fascism,"</a> social systems don't collapse overnight. They erode through small surrenders, through the gradual normalization of compliance as a civic virtue.</p><p>There is compliance with markets, with political power, with the unspoken rule that you must always be optimizing: for income, access, or institutional favor. Majors aren&#8217;t educational pathways anymore. They&#8217;re compliance signals. Just like a tariff exemption. Or a congressional vote.</p><h3>Colleges and Curiosity </h3><p>There was a great <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major">2023 New Yorker article</a> titled &#8216;The End of the English Major&#8217;. The piece walks through the downfall of humanities, and how enrollment in English and history is down by a third. At Harvard, a place that could theoretically subsidize students who wanted to explore these subjects, only 7% of students plan to pursue the humanities, down from 30% in the 1970s. </p><ul><li><p>Meanwhile, computer science (which is increasingly threatened by AI) and engineering have exploded. Why? Because STEM degrees signal utility. They&#8217;re seen as the most efficient way to comply with economic expectations - and they have been!</p></li><li><p>That&#8217;s not to say students don&#8217;t love literature or art. Many do! They just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re <em>allowed</em> to love them. One student at ASU said she viewed the humanities as a hobby that &#8220;you have to be affluent to take it on.&#8221; Others said they picked certain tracks hoping to make change, only to find themselves locked into rote performance. </p></li></ul><p>Students don&#8217;t trust that curiosity will pay off. They trust that optimization will - which is completely understandable. The result is a generation of workers trained to anticipate what&#8217;s expected, not to invent what&#8217;s needed. I did the same thing.</p><p>Eco would recognize this pattern immediately &#8211; the privileging of action over reflection, the suspicion of intellectual curiosity, and the reduction of education to technical utility rather than critical thinking.</p><p>What&#8217;s the problem with all of this? Well, increasingly, people can&#8217;t think.</p><p>The FT ran an article titled <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c9dcfc62-92c0-45db-8515-f20c97049652">The problem with workers who can&#8217;t think for themselves</a> which is pretty self-explanatory. Today&#8217;s graduates struggle with ambiguity. They aren&#8217;t trained to think beyond the lines. And it&#8217;s not their fault. We&#8217;ve spent decades putting kids into little boxes, and turns out, that&#8217;s not what employers really want. </p><p>And companies are making colleges now. Palantir, who has a business model of selling software to the government mostly, has their <a href="https://learn.palantir.com/page/training-tracks">own learning paths</a>. In the ads they talk about fighting &#8216;shallow consumerism&#8217; and &#8216;building to dominate&#8217; but then all the paths - understandably! - are data scientist, AI engineer, data engineer, etc, reinforcing the same narrow toolkit. And this is despite their CEO, Alex Karp<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, having degrees in Philosophy, law, and neoclassical social theory.</p><p>And these paths aren&#8217;t bad. I know many, many brilliant and bright and creative engineers and data scientists. But there is a holistic element to education that can get lost in just focusing on the narrow dimensions of computer. </p><p>Even Jamie Dimon (who has been quite outspoken against the trade war) has stated that he wants his successor at JP Morgan to have the qualities of courage, curiosity, grit, heart and capability, according <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/260dbc93-9fc2-4434-ac24-4dfc1cc926a6">to an interview with the FT.</a> Not technical fluency alone - but curiosity.</p><p>How do you cultivate curiosity? By embracing things beyond data and numbers (which again, are gorgeous in their own right) and by allowing people to explore things beyond optimization. </p><p>And to be clear, there is a lot going on with the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/us/universities-responses-investigations-funding-freeze/index.html">Trump administration and the universities</a>. Trump has sent out a list of <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/04/harvard-wont-comply-with-demands-from-trump-administration/">demands</a> to many institutions, including &#8220;audits of academic programs and departments, along with the viewpoints of students, faculty, and staff, and changes to the University&#8217;s governance structure and hiring practices&#8221; threatening to pull billions in research funding. Harvard was the first university to really say No and several of the other schools have followed suit. Trump is now threatening to take their tax exempt status and to tax them as a <a href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1912146719841661248">political entity. </a></p><p>So talking about embracing the humanities at a time when the universities are being threatened as institutions is a bit like discussing the paint on the walls as the house burns down, <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/03/abundance-ezra-klein-democrats-book-derek-thompson.html">to borrow from Henry Grabar.</a></p><p>But how we get out of this mess is by getting out of a compliance mindset. We need people to look at history and look beyond social media.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> We desperately need people to think again. Nowhere is this more evident than in Congress, where the same risk aversion that steers students away from the humanities now steers elected officials away from constitutional duty.</p><h3>Congress and The Paralysis of Political Survival</h3><p>Our elected officials are behaving the same way as the students and CEOs: with deference to power and a fear of standing out.</p><p>Take the current tariff escalation, an absolute nightmare. Trump has raised and lowered rates so many times that the <em>uncertainty</em> of the tariffs matters more than the <em>actual</em> tariffs themselves at this point. No one can keep up, not even people inside the administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/trump-trade-war-china-dilemma.html">according to the NYT</a>. </p><p><strong>Congress could stop him!</strong> They have the authority. There&#8217;s even a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would force a vote to approve any new tariffs after 60 days. Still, nothing.</p><p>This paralysis is what Eco described as a &#8220;fear of difference&#8221; where dissent is dangerous, alternative views are threatening, and deviation is punished. What we get is a legislative body that performs democracy, but no longer exercises its constitutional powers.</p><p>Standing up to Trump would mean risking access to donors, media cycles, committee power, and the favor of a political ecosystem that now functions more like a loyalty marketplace than a deliberative body. They ignore the Constitution at great costs to their constituents. </p><p>So they comply.</p><p>Even if they hate tariffs. Even as China<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/14/china-rare-earth-exports-halt-trump-trade-war-tariff-retaliation/"> initiates export controls on rare earth materials</a>, threatening entire supply chains. Even when farmers get clobbered (and will <a href="https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1912233782620365225">now have to get bailed out, </a>negating any positive revenue the tariffs could have generated). Even if they privately acknowledge the math doesn&#8217;t work. Because non-compliance is punished economically - or so they think. </p><p>Governor <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/14/whitmer-oval-office-photo-hiding-face-trump/83077642007/">Gretchen Whitmer&#8217;s visit to the White House</a> is a case study in this dynamic. She appeared to endorse Trump&#8217;s policies in a photo op, but later explained she felt she couldn&#8217;t object. Her constituents in Northern Michigan had been without power for 15 days at that point due to an ice storm. She feared losing federal aid if she upset the beast. Compliance, she hoped, would protect them. (It might. Or the funding may still be yanked, just like what happened <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/fema-ends-100-coverage-for-north-carolina-recovery-efforts/1765416">in North Carolina</a>.)</p><p>And this is happening at the business level too. As Anne Applebaum describers in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-kleptocracy-autocracy-inc/682281/?gift=hVZeG3M9DnxL4CekrWGK30qJ9ZHpfJ007YlGmU2wzkk&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">Kleptocracy, Inc</a> companies are bending the knee and are seeking presidential favor in exchange for regulatory relief or market access. Tim Cook called up Trump to get Apple exempted from the tariffs. Warner Bros has been told to offer <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/warner-bros-ceo-david-zaslav-hollywood-mogul.html">Don Jr a hunting show</a> to get some shine. Mark Zuckerberg called Trump a &#8216;badass&#8217; and is now trying to cozy up to the admin to get his antitrust case dismissed, as<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382?st=CSYEXg&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"> reported by WSJ</a> [edited for clarity]. </p><p>This kind of dealmaking benefits only the largest players. It hurts small businesses. It undermines trust in markets. And it encourages a culture where insider connections (not public service) dictate outcomes.</p><p>Our education system reinforces this behavior. Criterion-based assessments, as Michael Spence at UCL notes, teach students to anticipate what assessors want and deliver it. No risk. No ambiguity. Just match the rubric.</p><p>That&#8217;s also how most political careers function. Intuit what the power brokers want. Rehearse the right message. Vote accordingly. Diverge, and you&#8217;ll be kicked off committees or primaried out of existence.</p><p>Domestic compliance is dangerous enough. But on the global stage, it becomes catastrophic.</p><h3><strong>China and Trade Wars and Global Positioning</strong></h3><p>Compliance doesn&#8217;t work in geopolitics.</p><p>Trump thinks he&#8217;s playing poker with China, but <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2112e995-3b76-4886-ad45-5fc8991cd120">Xi seems to hold the better hand. </a>This is another of Eco&#8217;s concepts of &#8220;permanent war&#8221; where complex relationships are reduced to binary conflict. Tariffs become weapons. Dependency becomes betrayal.</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2112e995-3b76-4886-ad45-5fc8991cd120">The FT put it </a>bluntly: Trump&#8217;s erratic tariffs - randomly rising to 145% (and <a href="https://x.com/StockMKTNewz/status/1912461781567484381">now 245%?</a> We are totally off the Laffer curve) - have sparked chaos. He&#8217;s backtracked on smartphones, computers, bicycles, air conditioners (80% of the world&#8217;s air conditioners are made in China). No one knows what is happening. </p><p>Trump assumes China is weak because it exports more to us than we to them - the whole misunderstanding a trade deficit thing (we should really start calling it a capital surplus). But as Adam Posen <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/trade-wars-are-easy-lose">writes</a>, this is backwards: Americans <em>need</em> what China makes. </p><p>There are now videos floating around of <a href="https://x.com/JamesPGoddard90/status/1911300543609446734">Chinese OEMs</a> who make the products that American brands like Lululemon sell at markup to American consumers. Tariffs just raise prices for importers and consumers. Xi can wait. Trump cannot.</p><p>Still, China isn&#8217;t invincible. As <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/04/is-china-the-ultimate-free-rider.html">Tyler Cowen notes</a>, some of China&#8217;s success relies on American-led global order: on secure shipping lanes, free trade, and fossil fuel access. If Trump wrecks that order, China loses too.</p><p>Cowen also points out that Chinese power rises precisely <em>because</em> the West has outsourced its defense, its values, and in many ways its ability to think. And now, as the US retreats, some countries may harden rather than soften, potentially shutting China out. Still, the trade war will hurt both economies. China&#8217;s youth unemployment is high. Their economy isn&#8217;t growing very<a href="https://wsjchina.cmail19.com/t/d-e-sdjujdt-drdlkuihdd-r/"> fast anymore.</a> </p><p>What China wants some <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/china-open-to-talks-if-trump-shows-respect-names-point-person?taid=67ff6e1116f5bc00014b5c68&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">element of respect from the Trump administration</a> before entering talks, especially after JD Vance called Chinese manufacturers &#8216;peasants&#8217;. Trump is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/trump-says-up-to-china-to-make-tariff-offer-to-calm-trade-war?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDc0NTA5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1MzQ5ODk1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVJUUE9EV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTI4REQ5RTU2RTM0NjcyOEM1NEMwNDIzREJCRDAyNSJ9.1ZZTitI7lsAqGUkEjwra3Yq0ZaNEQcJ2SaCc1D1zh98">asking China to call him</a> and saying &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to make a deal with them&#8221; which feels&#8230; like a teenager who got into a fight with a friend and is asking another friend to talk to that friend so they can make up. Nevertheless, global superpowers and whatnot. </p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3e6174c-25e9-4428-9109-16e37319e9e2">Martin Wolf </a>argues out that China is now more predictable than the U.S. in the eyes of global business. It&#8217;s no longer a complement to the global economy - it&#8217;s a substitute.</p><p>Meanwhile, US policy keeps sabotaging its own firms. Trump&#8217;s latest curbs on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/nvidia-says-us-has-imposed-new-china-restrictions-on-h20-chips">Nvidia&#8217;s H20 chip</a> (which is a product specifically designed to comply with earlier restrictions on the H800 chip) will cost the company over $5.5 billion in writedowns and cause them to miss up to $18 billion in revenue this year. China has also halted all Boeing orders, which will result in <a href="https://x.com/angeloinchina/status/1912144636879188185">a $7-$10b loss for them</a>. A policy meant to hurt China is crippling American innovation<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>. </p><p>And that&#8217;s sort of where we are at with the trade war. It seems like Trump wants everyone to decouple from China and just work with the US, but just objectively, why would any country do that at this point? <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b101afd-b51c-4d64-ba2f-45ad4590e819">Brazil is a huge winner </a>because they have started exporting a ton of beef and soybeans to China. Why wouldn&#8217;t other countries follow suit? The US is <a href="https://x.com/KyivIndependent/status/1912289024179323179">buddying up to Russia</a>, has threatened to take over Canada and Greenland (who is <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/greenland-china-united-states-free-trade-agreement-independence-denmark-security-2059484">now approaching China!</a>) and is showing signs of authoritarianism.</p><p>There is a playbook for this kind of behavior. Europe has seen it before.</p><h3>Eco's Warning Signs</h3><p>As Umberto Eco warned in <em><a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism">Ur-Fascism</a></em><a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism">,</a> authoritarian systems don&#8217;t return with parades and uniforms. They return in habits. In rhetoric. In a culture where obedience masquerades as patriotism - or as economic strategy.</p><p>When disagreement becomes disloyalty, when nuance is dismissed as weakness, when conformity becomes civic virtue, we&#8217;re no longer living in a democracy. We&#8217;re participating in the performance of one.</p><p>Eco outlined a mindset: traditionalism, irrationalism, the cult of action for action&#8217;s sake. A worldview where diversity is feared, intellectualism is mocked, and masculinity is tied to violence. Where reflection is weakness, pacifism is betrayal, and Newspeak replaces thought.</p><p>It&#8217;s familiar.</p><p>We are raising a generation trained not to think but to comply. To be afraid of asking questions. To find safety in the right answer rather than in deeper inquiry.</p><p>The problem with this is simple: a compliance economy can&#8217;t invent. It can&#8217;t adapt. It can&#8217;t lead. It can only follow.</p><h3>Beyond Compliance</h3><p>We&#8217;re facing bond market chaos (it&#8217;s calmed down bit!). Fracturing alliances. A generation of workers who can&#8217;t afford housing, and a political class that can&#8217;t imagine anything beyond the spreadsheet. The compliance economy has manifested itself across all sectors: </p><ul><li><p>In education, we've created a generation that excels at following rubrics but struggles with ambiguity &#8211; exactly when technological change like AI demands adaptability and creative problem-solving. </p></li><li><p>In governance, Congress has withered as officials prioritize survival over constitutional responsibility.</p></li><li><p>In international relations, we&#8217;ve traded strategy for performance with reactive tariffs over long-term planning.</p></li></ul><p>The common thread? A system that punishes risk-taking while rewarding conformity. But there are concrete steps we can take, that many others have said before:</p><ul><li><p>In education, fund humanities departments. Build interdisciplinary programs. Measure outcomes beyond job placement (again, complicated right now). </p></li><li><p>In governance, restore congressional oversight. Reform campaign finance. Protect civil servants who uphold the rule of law.</p></li><li><p>In international policy, craft coherent trade strategies grounded in realism, not rhetoric, as so many strategists have already discussed.</p></li></ul><p>We <strong>don't need more people optimizing.</strong> We need people who can think. This means revaluing curiosity across institutions. It means reinvesting in education that rewards exploration, not just performance. It means electing leaders who are willing to ask questions, not just recite talking points. And it means giving students permission to study the world and not just navigate it. </p><p>Because a world built on compliance might function for a while. But it will never lead. And right now, we really need people who can lead.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

<![CDATA[ <p><em>Good morning from South Carolina. The tariffs are here. A brief explainer of what&#8217;s going on. </em></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

It then fell back down hours later when it turned out the Twitter account Walter Bloomberg (an account not affiliated with Bloomberg and who has shown signs of being <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3A%40DeItaone%20weekend%20off&amp;src=typed_query">an actual human a few times</a>) had somehow copied some a headline from somewhere (or perhaps decided to manipulate markets a bit, who knows).</p><p>The market reaction was important because it shows how <em>desperately</em> the market wants tariffs to be over. Investors were so ready to believe any sliver of good news<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> that they rallied on something that wasn&#8217;t real. And so far, the administration hasn&#8217;t given them any at all. Into Tuesday, markets were brimming with hope, trading mostly upwards, before giving an exasperated sigh and tumbling down as we all settled into the realization that these tariffs <strong>are</strong> coming. And they did.

Normally when stocks go down, we would see a <em>flight to safety</em> - the markets freaking out, so people are like &#8220;Well, you know what seems safe? US debt. The US is a safe, stable country, so I&#8217;ll buy up some Treasuries! Nothing can go wrong!&#8221; So they buy Treasuries, push bond prices up, and yields down. </p><p>But now, that isn&#8217;t the case. Yields are going up, meaning people are selling bonds, which could be the sign of a new era. Why? A few reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>China is dumping:</strong> Perhaps the bond selloff could be because <a href="https://x.com/dailydirtnap/status/1909723908195987799">China</a> or other foreign governments are selling <a href="https://x.com/mark_dow/status/1909687936758825159">US Treasuries</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> out of spite or fear. </p></li><li><p><strong>Forced selling: </strong>Perhaps it&#8217;s the<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-08/people-are-worried-about-deleveraging?srnd=undefined"> basis trade unwind</a> as Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-08/people-are-worried-about-deleveraging?srnd=undefined">explains</a> as the market deleverages, fueling forced selling, and various hedge funds blow up. </p></li><li><p><strong>Safe Haven Status</strong>: Maybe everyone&#8217;s just spooked that the &#8220;safe place&#8221; isn&#8217;t so safe anymore. If other countries think the US government could <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67616e19-9827-47d7-a4e0-ccaf344b7f57">yank Fed swap lines for political gain</a>, or suspect the White House might keep piling on tariffs until the economy cracks - maybe they decide, &#8220;Well no Treasuries for me, thanks.&#8221; </p></li><li><p><strong>Narratives</strong>: It&#8217;s really whatever people are saying about things. Vibes do matter because they are a leading indicator for actual data and positioning. </p></li></ol><p>And this gets into the tricky part - when and how does this stop? <strong>EVERYTHING is down</strong> - the dollar, oil<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>, bond prices, equities, credit spreads are spiking. This is very bad for the <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1909948373471199465">housing market too.</a> Everything is going exactly the way it&#8217;s not supposed to. And what can anyone do? </p><h3>Could the Fed or Congress Step In?</h3><p><strong>So maybe the Fed intervenes right?</strong> But the Federal Reserve can&#8217;t exactly cut rates when inflationary pressures are so high because tariffs and would rather tread water, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/fed-s-daly-says-policy-is-in-good-place-amid-trade-uncertainty">SF Fed President Mary Daly</a> said. But maybe the Fed can do some QE and <a href="https://x.com/lisaabramowicz1/status/1909891908194697288">buy up some bonds</a>, but that would create even <em>more</em> inflationary pressure. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Congress could also step in. It is their job.</strong> Remember, all of this is being done underneath the guise of emergency action. They can literally stop this at anytime. As the Washington Post writes &#8220;7 Republican senators are backing <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-cantwell-introduce-bill-to-restore-congress-constitutional-role-in-trade">a bipartisan bill</a> that would scrap new tariffs after 60 days unless Congress votes to approve them.&#8221; But they need at least 2/3 of senators (and 20 Republicans) to override Trump&#8217;s presumed veto. They don&#8217;t seem to want to do that.</p><ul><li><p>And so some senators - especially those from manufacturing&#8208;heavy states - could push for more targeted trade deals to blunt the impact of tariffs on local businesses. Others, particularly where agriculture is a major employer, could lobby for carve&#8208;outs or partial tariff relief if other countries retaliate against American farm exports. There could already be a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/farmers-tariffs-trump-trade-war-00271146">bail-out on the way for farmers</a>, like we had during the first set of tariffs (which negated any revenue collected from those tariffs, but anyways)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>At the <strong>state level</strong>, governors could negotiate local business partnerships or foreign direct&#8208;investment deals. For instance, a state could offer tax incentives or simplified permitting to try and bring companies to build factories there, effectively creating mini-trade or investment zones. This would put states in tension with White House policy, but states will need to protect local jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Really it&#8217;s the federal government: </strong>The ideal situation would be for the administration to call off the tariffs, but when policy is pageantry, that doesn&#8217;t happen. Trump is not replying to anyone on negotiations as of the morning of April 9th, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/trump-tariffs-talks-countries-00279959">according to Politico</a> (but they are <a href="https://x.com/JesseCohenInv/status/1909910716275900711">&#8220;kissing his ass&#8221;</a>) and now he is talking about tariffing <a href="https://x.com/JReinerMD/status/1909795745135308941">pharmaceuticals</a>. </p></li></ul><p>The problem with the whole yields thing is that the administration wanted to get them lower so they could refinance the debt at a lower rate, reduce interest payments, and ride off into the sunset or something as I wrote about <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/an-orchestrated-recession-trumps">here</a>. But now, not only is there a potential recession on the horizon, but yields aren&#8217;t <em>any</em> lower - a perfect stagflationary combination. High inflation, low economic growth, and high unemployment. </p><h3>What happens to the World Order?</h3><p>If you&#8217;ve been reading my last few pieces, you know I&#8217;ve hammered on these tariffs for a while (even before the election, when I first interviewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx-0R49XATQ">Erica York from the Tax Foundation</a>). The administration is basically demanding that other countries either pay new fees to trade with us or <em>else</em>. </p><p>And so - what is the US to the rest of the world? A lot of people think that the US is subsidizing the rest of the world, when it&#8217;s really the opposite, <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/crashing-the-car-of-pax-americana/">as Ben Hunt wrote about. </a></p><ol><li><p>The US was the prime beneficiary of a stable, trust&#8208;based global system. The rest of the world has really subsidized the American lifestyle. This stable system used to be called <em>Pax Americana</em>, where for nearly 80 years, the US gave other countries security, open trade lanes, a stable dollar, etc. in exchange for them conceding broad US influence over global rules and institutions. So the US enjoyed unique privileges, like cheaper borrowing costs and the ability to run persistent trade deficits (which aren&#8217;t a bad thing) while other countries&#8217; demand for dollars and Treasuries effectively subsidized its standard of living. </p></li><li><p>Now the US is turning around and demanding a fee that doesn&#8217;t match to any type of math (in fact, the math used is <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/president-trumps-tariff-formula-makes-no-economic-sense-its-also-based-on-an-error/">wrong</a> as AEI wrote about). So countries start asking: &#8220;If the US is going to nickel&#8208;and&#8208;dime us for every container ship and submarine, maybe we&#8217;ll just build trade deals with each other, avoid the drama.&#8221; So we end up pushing them away and melt down our own advantage, the trust.</p></li></ol><p>So it&#8217;s all changing and maybe the reserve currency too. We used to have one big question: &#8220;Will China dethrone the dollar?&#8221; That&#8217;s probably too simplistic. We might instead see a bunch of <strong>&#8220;</strong>currency clubs<strong>&#8221;</strong> forming, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2009/09/cohen.htm">as the IMF has wrote about before</a>, like small blocs or bilateral deals, some anchored in digital clearinghouses, some in partial pegging, each cutting reliance on the US bit by bit. </p><p>Rather than a single rival currency taking down the dollar, we could get this mosaic that collectively reduces US sway. The net result is the same: less automatic demand for Treasuries, more fragmentation, less &#8220;safe haven&#8221; reflex.</p><h3>How is China Responding?</h3><p>A lot of people are saying that the ultimate end game here is to decimate China. Treasury Secretary Bessent said that they could remove Chinese stocks from US exchanges because <a href="https://x.com/StockMKTNewz/status/1909935751250296927">&#8220;everything is on the table&#8221; </a>and China has retaliated with a 50% tariff on <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f3e0ee58-47a0-41c4-b021-ed19d27da6e7">US imports. </a>So we are officially in a trade war. </p><p>The yuan is down as China devalues their currency to try and make their exports look more attractive (which is so complicated and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/pboc-greenlights-yuan-weakness-with-fixing-past-7-2-per-dollar">has so many secondary effects</a>) and presumably preps for maybe a<a href="https://x.com/SaraEisen/status/1909708744239296921"> capital war</a> with the US. China is a tough opponent for many reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>They don&#8217;t need the US like they used to.</strong> They diversified who they send exports to (Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia). and the US just really isn&#8217;t that big of a piece of the pie. Some people will argue &#8220;well the US will bankrupt all countries with these tariffs so that way no one can afford to buy from China&#8221; which really feels like taking the chess board and spinning it around in another dimension - but perhaps it&#8217;s true. </p></li><li><p><strong>They are able to withstand much more pain than the US.</strong> This is a complicated argument, but the American public was irate during the last year of the Biden administration because of inflation. If that comes back up again with tariffs (which it will, Trump&#8217;s first term tariffs <a href="https://x.com/ericadyork/status/1909658697640329671">drove import prices up</a>), it will likely torch Trump&#8217;s polling (maybe?) although the administration seems to think it will <a href="https://x.com/maiamindel/status/1909766118815727940">solidify their stance with Main Street</a> (and Main Street and Wall Street are basically the same thing at this point, let&#8217;s be real)</p></li><li><p><strong>China has good factories.</strong> They do not fear automation as <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations">some people in the US do</a>. They have factories that are entirely autonomous. </p></li><li><p><strong>That&#8217;s not even mentioning how many high&#8208;end electronics, batteries, and basically everything on Amazon still runs through Chinese supply chains.</strong> So if the US truly wants to isolate China, there will be massive price increases, and so again you can guess how that might go over with American consumers who are used to inexpensive things. </p></li></ol><p>We assume big trade blocs are decided by governments. But remember, tariffs are paid by companies exporting to the US, not the countries. And increasingly, corporations, like Apple, Samsung, etc will likely have to do their own foreign policy of sorts to ensure continuity. They might have to form new shipping lanes and manufacturing footprints outside the US creating a quasi-private global network that could eventually become more important than official Washington&#8211;led institutions. However, it&#8217;s of course complicated, because as Scott Galloway talked about, Trump has really done a number on <a href="https://x.com/hissgoescobra/status/1909704086900945339">America&#8217;s brand</a>, which hurts American companies. </p><h3>The Myth vs Reality of Reshoring</h3><p>Part of the official rationale is &#8220;We&#8217;ll just make everything here.&#8221; And that gets into the administration&#8217;s hyperfixation on bringing back old&#8208;school manufacturing. A few things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We already had manufacturing growth:</strong> Manufacturing actually has boomed over the past <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1909633783176843596">four years</a> without use of broad tariffs as Joe Weisenthal pointed out underneath the IRA and the CHIPS Act</p></li><li><p><strong>They are yearning for an era that is gone:</strong>The administration has talked about lines of workers bolting in cellphone screws just like we used to in the 1950s or something (Trump specifically<a href="https://x.com/sunnyright/status/1909344206423736529"> likes to compare us to the &#8220;golden age&#8221; of 1870 to 1913</a>, because we didn&#8217;t have an income tax). This resonates politically to a certain extent: nostalgic images of steel mills or assembly plants symbolize American economic power, when the US was the only country post-World Wars that had the capacity to build. That time is over.</p></li><li><p><strong>This will not solve our societal problems:</strong> A lot of people are acting as a spokesperson for the everyday man, like the guy below. People left manufacturing in droves once they could - and that&#8217;s not to say that the work isn&#8217;t important (it&#8217;s extremely important!) but it&#8217;s complicated. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg" width="595" height="385.45652173913044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:596,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:595,&quot;bytes&quot;:70021,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160878215?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08b4fc33-80d6-4277-94dd-7649c9b6a571_920x596.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Anecdotes</strong>: Then you read what Gary Cohn said to Trump in his first term, as <a href="https://x.com/jordanschnyc/status/1909650679494324608">Jordan Schneider</a> shared.

So sure, you don&#8217;t need to eat bananas, but what about all the small businesses (or giant YouTubers) that rely on things we simply <em>cannot</em> make here?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png" width="1204" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:1204,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:94460,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160878215?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hThW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099064a4-0809-4809-897e-eefe7758841d_1204x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Take coffee for example. I have had two cups of coffee editing this piece this morning. The beans are from Colombia. We cannot grow those coffee beans here because the US doesn&#8217;t have the proper climate. So we have a trade deficit in coffee - but that isn&#8217;t bad, because Colombia has a comparative advantage in coffee. So we buy their coffee, because Americans love coffee, and they get US dollars that they spend on other things. Everyone benefits.</p><p>And that&#8217;s the frustrating part - we shouldn&#8217;t dream of making socks here. The real pivot to the US is advanced technology like AI, chips, biotech. By decoupling or punishing foreign partners, we might accelerate them building their own R&amp;D ecosystems. If they succeed, they&#8217;ll rely less on this really important American technology. Then we&#8217;re not just ceding a shoe factory or whatever, we&#8217;re ceding the next wave of innovation. That&#8217;s a deeper, darker implication. </p><h3>Potential Next Steps for Policy</h3><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/ray-dalio-says-once-in-lifetime-major-breakdown-is-occurring?taid=67f5fc84897a3b00016b310e&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Ray Dalio has come out</a> and said &#8220;hey everyone, it&#8217;s not about the tariffs, it&#8217;s about all the debt and we need to rebalance it eventually&#8221; and there is of course truth in that.

We&#8217;re talking about an entire ecosystem of trust that took decades to build. Up until recently, the world was okay funneling money into Treasuries and letting the US call a lot of shots because they believed we&#8217;d be a somewhat consistent hegemony. </p><p>If we keep lashing out unpredictably, or treat alliances like subscription fees, that intangible trust fizzles, and so do all the benefits we reaped from it - like cheap borrowing rates, supply chain stability, and a seat at the head of every negotiating table. Dalio&#8217;s &#8216;Overall Big Cycle&#8217; is here, but torpedoing the world into an economic downturn and kneecapping industry probably isn&#8217;t the best solution to fix it.</p><p>Even if next month the White House says, &#8220;Oh, never mind, no more tariffs!&#8221; the rest of the world has now glimpsed the risk that we could do it again. That&#8217;s enough to push them to form backup plans - like forging more robust trade ties with each other, or seeking alternate reserve currencies.</p><p>What should the US do instead?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Target actual trade abuse </strong>Focus on verifiable IP theft, forced tech transfers, or unfair subsidies. Instead of slapping blanket tariffs on entire sectors, create narrow carve&#8208;outs (like for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-fishing-shrimp.html">shrimpers</a>) or penalty rates only for proven violations and reduce collateral damage for U.S. businesses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest in Workforce &amp; Tech: </strong>Bring back the CHIPS Act! High&#8208;tech manufacturing incentives encourage fab building in the US without punishing consumers with broad tariffs. Fund vocational training, apprenticeships, and community college programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart Industrial Policy:</strong> Modernize roads, ports, and broadband to reduce supply chain frictions and boost domestic competitiveness. Instead of tariffs, use incentives to attract high&#8208;value industries, especially those critical to national security. </p></li><li><p><strong>Reinvigorate Trade Alliance: </strong>Improve USMCA, or rejoin modified TPP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership">CPTPP</a>) under terms that protect domestic interests</p></li><li><p><strong>Global Leadership: </strong>Show consistency in policy, stop tweeting, and demonstrate a willingness to stick to negotiated terms.</p></li></ol><p>Hopefully. But what&#8217;s next? We could imagine a few scenarios:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Slow Fragmentation</strong>. The trade war never hits a single dramatic meltdown, but the global system gradually rewires itself. Over time, the US is just one big player among many, not the gravitational center.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partial Climbdown</strong>. The administration sees a recession looming and discreetly unwinds some tariffs. Markets calm down a bit, but the damage is done, and trust remains low.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full-Blown Crisis and Rebuild</strong>. Something snaps.- like massive Treasury dumping or a meltdown in supply chains - and everyone rushes back to the table for a new Bretton Woods. The Us gives up some privileges to restore stability.</p></li></ol><p>None of these look exactly like the old normal, because once the illusions of reliability or hegemony are shattered, you can&#8217;t just re&#8208;mint them. Sure, we can maybe salvage an equilibrium, but it&#8217;ll be on new terms.</p><p>Meanwhile, near&#8208;shoring might skip us, allies might shrug off our big threats, and we might find that a cunning &#8220;automation plus tariffs&#8221; approach doesn&#8217;t actually create a ton of manufacturing jobs anyway.</p><p>Tese tariff wars and bond panics are about more than short&#8208;term headlines. They might reshape how capital flows, how supply chains form, and how the world cooperates on everything from financial crises to war. And we might not see a single cataclysmic day - just a series of smaller breakdowns that add up to a world where America isn&#8217;t the anchor it once was, and everyone else has moved on.</p><p>Once we blow up the intangible architecture of trust, a partial walk-back won&#8217;t fix it. If we don&#8217;t see this soon, we may wander through a patchwork of mini crises and alliances, ironically discovering that the old system - flawed as it was - was actually the best deal the U.S. ever had.</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>even if some domestic supporters believe tariffs can fix decades of uneven trade practices,</em> we run the risk of hobbling ourselves more than we help. A smarter approach would combine targeted enforcement of legitimate trade abuses, real support for high&#8208;tech manufacturing, and genuine leadership on the global stage. Without that, the American consumer will keep paying to throw away the very trust that made us a superpower in the first place.</p><h3>What can you do?</h3><p>None of this is investment advice, just ideas.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Check your portfolio mix:</strong> Make sure you know how much of your investments are in stocks, bonds, and other assets. Consider diversifying abroad. Make sure you understand any ETFs or mutual funds that you hold. Holding some mix of equities, cash, different bond maturities, or even other assets (like real estate) can help balance risks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cash Reserve: </strong>If markets get rocky, having a few months of expenses in cash (or something very close to cash) is a good cushion. It keeps you from being forced to sell investments at a bad time.</p></li><li><p><strong>High yield savings account:</strong> If you&#8217;re risk&#8208;averse, stick it in a HYSA. You&#8217;ll earn a yield and can exit fairly quickly if needed. I have about half my portfolio in this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t panic sell:</strong> Headlines can sound frightening, but panicked selling rarely helps. If you have a diversified, long-term portfolio, short-term volatility is often just noise.</p></li></ol><p>If you see alarming headlines, don&#8217;t let fear dictate your moves. This uncertainty won&#8217;t go away anytime soon, so stay calm, know your time horizon and adjust your portfolio&#8217;s risk level to something you can live with.

<![CDATA[ <p><em>We call a tariff a protective measure. It does protect; it protects the consumer very well against one thing. It protects the consumer against low prices. - Milton Friedman</em></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Welcome to a new project!</strong> This is my version of AI - the <strong>A</strong>ctual<strong> I</strong>nbox - but it&#8217;s a human answering questions from other humans! Ever since the release of my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Economy-Money-Markets-Really/dp/0593727878">In This Economy? </a>I&#8217;ve gotten many, many questions about a lot of things, which has understandably increased over the last few months. My job is explaining stuff, and I try my best to cover as much as I can in short form videos, but I think it&#8217;s time to do a series of experimental biweekly Q&amp;As to answer some of those questions (many of which are similar!). While I can&#8217;t get to them all, I hope it will help.

President Trump&#8217;s newly announced tariffs are sparking all sorts of confusion, and rightfully so. Below, I&#8217;ll address some questions I&#8217;ve been asked over the past few days.</p><h3>Oh, Tariffs</h3><p>I am sure you have countless notes in your inboxes this morning talking about the tariffs announced by President Trump. The announcement was far more extreme than I think most people were imagining.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> The tariff situation seems to stem from:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A series of economic misunderstandings</strong>: What tariffs are, what trade deficits are, what reshoring US manufacturing actually means, etc</p></li><li><p><strong>An ignorance of history: T</strong>he last time we did mass tariffs was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations">1828</a> and 1930 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot&#8211;Hawley_Tariff_Act#:~:text=The%20act%20and%20tariffs%20imposed,effects%20of%20the%20Great%20Depression.">(Smoot-Hawley), a</a>nd we faced a deepening depression after each one.

As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtjwihUeNuQ">Barry Bannister of Stifel said on CNBC</a>, this is pretty much a stagflationary shock but with a reason - Middle America <em>has</em> been hollowed out. Something like this was bound to happen eventually. People are frustrated, and it is because we have extreme wealth inequality. A lot of people are <a href="https://x.com/bungarsargon/status/1907585936256352590">justifying the tariffs</a> as a way to return wealth to the working class, but the way that these were rolled out, how sweeping they are, and how inflammatory any discussion around them is - it&#8217;s more likely to make things much harder. But&#8230; what happens next? </p><h4>Q1: What is happening?? Are we cooked?</h4><p>President Trump declared a &#8220;national emergency&#8221; over what he calls &#8220;large and persistent U.S. trade deficits.&#8221; The administration&#8217;s view is that the U.S. is losing jobs and money because of &#8220;unfair&#8221; trade. The White House says that adding tariffs will force companies to bring production back home, thereby boosting U.S. manufacturing and creating more jobs.</p><p>Tariffs are import taxes<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. And most of the time, it&#8217;s not really the countries that pay for them, it&#8217;s companies (and then, usually consumers). <a href="https://x.com/KathyJones/status/1907551305524195473">As Kathy Jones said:</a> </p><blockquote><p>It is the companies importing the goods that pay the tariff. These then get passed along to consumers (as much as possible). It's not really a tariff on a country - it's a tax on the goods imported.</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s important to remember here. China isn&#8217;t really paying the China tariffs, it&#8217;s companies that operate in China and send stuff to the States. There are two main layers to Trump&#8217;s new tariffs: </p><ol><li><p><strong>A 10% &#8220;baseline&#8221; tariff</strong> on most imported goods, effective April 5.</p></li><li><p><strong>A set of &#8220;kind reciprocal&#8221; tariffs</strong> that vary<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/explainers/what-are-trump-s-reciprocal-tariffs"> country by country,</a> targeting about 60 nations deemed &#8220;worst offenders&#8221; (including one nation with zero people in it!) These reciprocal rates kick in on April 9 (presumably to give room for some type of negotiation). So for example, China&#8217;s total tariff rate is effectively around 54% on top of older, existing tariffs. China has already <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84fe4e66-74ef-4517-8733-2c84f77ea3b7">retaliated with a 34%</a> tariff on all US imports.</p></li></ol><p>Canada and Mexico already face separate 25% tariffs over other disputes, though they&#8217;re technically not added onto the brand-new set. A lot of people have said things along the lines of &#8220;well, other countries tariff us, why shouldn&#8217;t we tariff them&#8221; - and<a href="https://x.com/ProjectLiberal/status/1907795363118899585"> this is an adjusted chart</a> of the actual tariff rates countries charge to the US. It&#8217;s much lower than the White House stated. You can also see this in what we did to Japan.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png" width="672" height="245" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:245,&quot;width&quot;:672,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:35132,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160491153?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2bS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd11395-f9cb-4505-865f-4c4b331bd247_672x245.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>So we aren&#8217;t necessarily cooked, but these tariffs represent a massive shift in trade policy (and wild economic calculations!) We could be staring at higher consumer costs, a potential trade war, and an economic slowdown, as I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/an-orchestrated-recession-trumps">previously</a>. </p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Expect near-term turbulence in the form higher prices, possible retaliation from trading partners, and market volatility. We&#8217;re not doomed, but the road ahead is bumpy.</p><h4>Q2: I live in Cleveland so the talk of bringing back manufacturing is great. But could these new tariffs really bring jobs, or is it all hype?</h4><p>It&#8217;s complicated. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-manufacturing-economy.html">Talmon Joseph Smith of the NYT</a> has a great in-depth piece exploring the years of underinvestment in places like your home in Cleveland and my home in Kentucky. We need to reinvest in the manufacturing areas that got left behind, but we should dream bigger than making socks and toasters. </p><p>But why do we <em>want</em> to return? After WWII, the US dominated global manufacturing - we were one of the only large industrial bases not destroyed by war. But over decades, Europe and Asia rebuilt (and innovated). As a share of total employment, manufacturing in the US started steadily shrinking as we focused on other things. Many people see tariffs as a quick fix to revive factories here, but modern manufacturing is highly automated. There are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automation</strong>: Robots often do the bulk of the heavy lifting, even in lower-wage countries, which could mean fewer jobs per factory, because machines do much of the work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Global supply chains</strong>: Companies might shift some operations to Mexico or into the US, but that&#8217;s expensive and may not create a big wave of new US jobs. It might be cheaper to just eat the tariff (translation: pass to consumer) and continue to produce abroad and just sell <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1907812445260800264">the US fewer sneakers at higher prices.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Competition</strong>: Countries like China aren&#8217;t just churning out cheap, low-skill products, they&#8217;re leaders in advanced manufacturing (e.g., robotics, electric vehicles, semiconductors). They already see automation as an advantage, not a job-killer, which is something the US has struggled with (t<a href="https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations">he UAW opposing automation, for example)</a>. If we really want to produce good stuff here, we have to think to the future, not the past. Also foreign production should be thought as a <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01450/120870/Exporting-Global-Sourcing-and-Multinational">complement to domestic production</a> - it helps us make better things here to be able to rely on comparative advantage from abroad. </p></li></ul><p>There&#8217;s also pure economics that complicate the reshoring argument - tariffs will slow down the economy, leading to less investment. Businesses don&#8217;t make as much money, so they <a href="https://x.com/stevehou0/status/1907918185753620872">don&#8217;t build as much</a>. Also, the US is so uncertain now, that no one will want to invest here (and also all the rules might change again in the <a href="https://x.com/firstadopter/status/1907558575351714267">next election cycle)</a>. </p><p>Argentina fell into this trap under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20three%20decades,the%20Argentine%20economy%20deteriorated%20notably.">Peronism</a> - it was one of the top 10 wealthiest countries in the world in the early 1900s. But they decided that they could do it all alone, tumbled from their perch, and have never recovered. </p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Without sustained <em>industrial policy</em> (think: training, tech investment, stable regulations), tariffs alone won&#8217;t bring a big wave of well-paying manufacturing jobs. </p><h4>Q3: Has the administration revealed a scheme for resolving the reciprocal tariffs? How did they come up with these numbers? Does a trade deficit matter? </h4><p>Well, the White House is using a method that basically divided the US trade deficit by total imports from each country. Then it halves that number, calling it the &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariff rate. Alphaville has a good explainer <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e025d7e6-512d-4e82-9c25-7900b94ac153">here</a>. In simpler terms: the bigger the trade deficit the US has with a specific country, the higher that country&#8217;s tariff gets. But it&#8217;s a little confusing!</p><ul><li><p><strong>The calculation:</strong> So, as Bloomberg wrote, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/trump-s-reciprocal-tariff-formula-is-all-about-trade-deficits?srnd=homepage-americas">China</a> &#8220;had a trade surplus of $295 billion with the US last year on total exports of $438 billion &#8212; a ratio of 68%&#8221; so divide that by 2 and you get a tariff rate of 34%. </p></li><li><p><strong>US comparative advantage:</strong> Trump does seem to be quite obsessed with eliminating the trade deficit we have in goods, which would require the US to produce apparel and electronics and somehow grow all types of fruits and vegetables. However, we have a trade surplus in services, like high end manufacturing and finance, which is ideal for an advanced economy. </p></li><li><p><strong>Trade deficits:</strong> These don&#8217;t automatically mean a country is &#8220;cheating.&#8221; A trade deficit means we import more from a country than we export to it. This can happen for benign reasons like strong consumer spending, the US dollar&#8217;s global strength, or the fact we don&#8217;t grow certain crops here. If we reduce imports from China via high tariffs, we might just buy from Vietnam or another country (likely Latin America based on the tariff rates). The overall deficit just shifts around because we simply cannot produce things like bananas or coffee here. Also, these are countries that send things to us, like Cambodia, so we have a giant trade deficit - but it isn&#8217;t because they are taking advantage of us, it&#8217;s because they simply can&#8217;t afford to buy our things. There is no way to &#8216;even out&#8217; that deficit, and it really shouldn&#8217;t be a goal. </p></li><li><p>The world&#8217;s poorest countries are facing a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/trump-tariffs-are-disaster-for-the-world-s-poorest-countries?srnd=homepage-americas">double headwind of reduced aid and massive tariffs </a>which could lead to geopolitical instability (and the continued rise of China). </p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png" width="1176" height="430" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:430,&quot;width&quot;:1176,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:130298,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160491153?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fXh3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb800c3d-dd16-42d9-b5a2-69e5739cd477_1176x430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: A trade deficit isn&#8217;t automatically evidence of wrongdoing. Targeting it through broad tariffs can lead to supply-chain reshuffles rather than a genuine return of production to the US.</p><h4>Q4: I really need help understanding how the dollar is impacted by all of this.</h4><p>The US dollar tumbled after all of this was announced, which is confusing, because normally tariffs strengthen a currency. As <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-dollar">Paul Krugman explained on Axios </a></p><blockquote><p>Tariffs are supposed to reduce demand for imports. In the U.S. that would mean there's less need for businesses to exchange dollars for other currencies to buy foreign goods. That would translate into fewer dollars to trade on the currency market. Less supply means higher prices, but only if demand stays relatively constant</p></blockquote><p> That&#8217;s normally what <em>should</em> happen. But the dollar went down because other countries don&#8217;t really like us right now. It&#8217;s a combination of lower net capital inflows (people choosing not to invest or buy in the US) and concerns about US growth prospects.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png" width="663" height="349.2776025236593" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:501,&quot;width&quot;:951,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:663,&quot;bytes&quot;:101547,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160491153?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!54_j!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82746f5b-012d-4a87-9b34-9032010ca8e1_951x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The dollar&#8217;s unexpected drop underlines global distrust in US policy.

They moved out of China to avoid older tariffs - only to face new reciprocal tariffs in their new hubs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Business responses vary, but none are painless. Many will pass costs on to consumers or hold off on expansion until the tariff landscape stabilizes.</p><h4>Q6: Could this trigger a global trade war?</h4><p>It&#8217;s a big risk. Tariffs often spark tit-for-tat retaliation. For instance, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/germany-and-france-push-for-a-more-aggressive-tariff-response?srnd=homepage-americas">the EU</a> (especially France and Germany) have signaled they&#8217;re looking at countermoves, like imposing their own tariffs on US goods or even taxing US tech and service companies. Historically, escalating protectionism (like the 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs) can really intensify global economic downturns. There&#8217;s also a possibility other nations will hold off and attempt to negotiate (like <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/europe/?url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-likely-to-negotiate-more-with-us-under-section-4c-and-not-retaliate-12983727.html">India</a>). But the higher the U.S. tariffs go, the more likely it is that trading partners will feel forced to respond. </p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: History is pretty clear: widespread tariffs can escalate quickly, harming global growth. We may see trade partners band together against the US or wait to see if our politics shift.</p><h4>Q7: How will this impact China?</h4><p>China will likely be a winner here. The tariffs could be quite bumpy for them in the short run, but in the long run, the new world order to coalesce around China in a way that completely shuts the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/trump-gives-china-s-xi-a-chance-to-win-over-world-hit-by-tariffs">US out of the picture. </a>That&#8217;s the real short-term pain, long-term gain of this situation.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Other countries suffering are their gain:</strong> China will obviously be hit quite hard by a 54% tariff, but because the poorer countries around them are being hit hard too, so it could could provide a boost to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/us-tariffs-seen-as-far-worse-shock-to-china-than-first-trade-war?srnd=homepage-americas">China</a>. As Bloomberg wrote, the tariff rates on countries like Vietnam (which, for example, produces half of Nike&#8217;s shoes due to the company trying to <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1907746876457197790">diversify away from China</a>) &#8220;could potentially moderate the impact on China, as it may become more costly to substitute its products with imports from other countries.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>They have smart views on automation:</strong> China (and others) view robots as a complement to human labor, not a threat. They invest big in AI, robotics, and advanced manufacturing. That&#8217;s part of why they&#8217;ve become the world&#8217;s factory - it&#8217;s not just cheap labor; it&#8217;s also their scale, efficiency, and continuous improvement.</p></li><li><p><strong>We are hurting ourselves:</strong> The tariffs really impact Americans the most. It's a good time to be a competitor. And other countries will decide to trade with one another - China, Japan, and South Korea held their first economic talks in 5 years(!) because this stuff is so messy.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png" width="754" height="553" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:553,&quot;width&quot;:754,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34330,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160491153?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bymh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdd3a6bc-4e9b-428c-b8ee-84c7e6bfba2c_754x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Despite short-term pain, China could emerge stronger if it capitalizes on global frustration with US tariffs, invests in advanced tech (which they are on an absolutely unprecedented scale), and becomes the pivot point for trade alliances. </p><h4>Q8: Didn&#8217;t Congress used to be in charge of tariffs? What are they even doing right now?</h4><p>Under the Constitution, Congress does indeed control tariffs. However, a variety of laws allow the president to impose them for &#8220;national security&#8221; or under &#8220;emergency&#8221; authority (Trump did these tariffs under the guise of a trade emergency, and the Canada and Mexico tariffs under the guise of fentanyl and borders). </p><p>This is a workaround that oversteps constitutional bounds.

The Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will result in an average tax increase of more than <a href="https://x.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1907792083533848728">$2,100 per US household</a> and the Budget Lab at Yale estimates it could cost as high as <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/where-we-stand-fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-all-us-tariffs-enacted-2025-through-april">$3,800</a>. TF estimates that tariffs will reduce US GDP by almost 1% and cut hours for over half a million full time jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stock market volatility:</strong> The stock market is already wobbling - especially retail, tech, manufacturing, and consumer goods stocks. A lot of people will say that the stock market isn&#8217;t the economy and therefore this shouldn&#8217;t matter - but the stock market is the economy in many ways, especially in terms of how businesses <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1907808972003750009">choose to spend and hire.</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Potential job uncertainty: </strong>Industries that rely heavily on trade (importers, exporters, and logistics). Some might cut costs (like Whirlpool and Stellantis) or trim payroll if profit margins get squeezed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bailouts</strong>: There are already talks of needing to bail out farmers. The US spent<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/14/donald-trump-coronavirus-farmer-bailouts-359932"> $32 billion bailing them out</a> during the first round of tariffs, which has two implications - 1) any money that could have possibly been generated from tariffs will have to go to support instead of &#8216;paying down the debt&#8217; and 2) that&#8217;s going to be a tremendous amount of bail out money, considering that the first round of tariffs were on $380 billion of goods - and these<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/"> tariffs are on $2.5 trillion. </a>Just with napkin math, that could be a $210 billion bailout package for farmers. </p></li><li><p><strong>Bond market distress</strong>: <a href="https://x.com/KathyJones/status/1907810623473205665">High yield credit default swaps </a>have risen on tariff concerns, which is concerning. The last thing we want is a bunch of defaults - that could very much complicate the macroeconomic picture. According to <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1907750978083778749">Deutsche Bank, </a>&#8220;a drop in the dollar, a drop in US equities, and a rise in term premium in US Treasuries would be the strongest market signal that a process of US disinvestment is accelerating&#8221; Something to keep an eye on. </p></li></ul><p>And it&#8217;s complicated - tariffs can turbocharge price increases, but they could lead to disinflation in the long run. The last time that we did them in 2018, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/pubpapers/JEP-tariffs-2019.pdf">prices went up and have sta</a>yed up. The way they could be deflationary is dependent on the Fed - so say, prices rise, costs are passed off to consumers, Fed tightens, and we get eventual disinflation, but that&#8217;s a long and arduous path. </p><p>As a result, many forecasters think inflation could spike, adding pressure on the Fed to juggle price stability with the risk of economic slowdown. <a href="https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1907823853440520390">Nick Timiraos highlights </a>that the Fed is in a really tough spot - prices are high, hiring is down and rate cuts could boost rate-sensitive sectors like cars and housing, but those sectors are slammed by tariffs, so it&#8217;s almost a zeroing out of impact. Powell spoke on Friday, April 4th, and <a href="https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1908179189364035656">said</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.</p></blockquote><p>That means a lot of messaging. Get ready for some Fed speaker series.</p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Good personal finance habits (like saving diligently, diversifying investments, and monitoring inflation risk) help cushion volatility. We likely will see prices go up. Certain industries (farmers, exporters) might need massive bailouts, which ironically chews up any revenue tariffs generate.</p><h4>Q10: He will just negotiate like he always does, right?</h4><p>The administration says it&#8217;s open to revising rates &#8220;downward&#8221; if other countries reduce their barriers or cut bilateral trade deficits. If big deals get hammered out, tariffs could shrink. Trump said he was open to negotiations - he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-live-updates-stock-market-trade-war.html">went back on what aides</a> were saying he was going to do which was not negotiate, so, who knows. </p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Negotiations are on the table, but success depends on whether trade partners see a genuine path to compromise - or they decide to retaliate.</p><h4>Q11: Is there a historical example of tariffs being used as a negotiation tool that worked out well? </h4><p>Welp. The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff is the classic cautionary tale. It aimed to protect US jobs during the Great Depression but led to retaliatory tariffs worldwide, shrinking international trade and worsening the global downturn. It&#8217;s not a perfect parallel, but it&#8217;s a reminder that broad, giant tariffs can create unintended economic damage - and can put us in the Kindleberger downward spiral. As Thomas Sowell <a href="https://reason.com/2018/11/26/thomas-sowell-returns/">said in a 2018 interview with Reason</a>, &#8220;You do not make America great again by raising the price to Americans, which is what a tariff does.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png" width="605" height="620.1439299123905" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:799,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:605,&quot;bytes&quot;:457304,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/160491153?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!td5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f99966-f2ba-4bb1-aace-f609b0ebeb59_799x819.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: History shows that large-scale protectionism can backfire spectacularly. Any short-term gains often vanish in the face of retaliations and global slowdowns.</p><h4>What&#8217;s Next?</h4><p>Here is a probability tree from JP Morgan on what could happen to the economy over the next year. They see a 60% chance of a downturn on the horizon. I think that uncertainty is expensive, and the policies as a whole - the gutting of funding, the tariffs, the showmanship, the isolationism, the irrelevance (we&#8217;ve decided to become 17th century Spain in many ways) - create a painful economic environment for everyone.

So a quick news roundup: </p><ul><li><p><strong>25% tariffs on autos:</strong> These could raise car prices as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/car-prices-are-poised-for-12-000-surge-on-trump-s-new-tariffs">high as $12,000<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </a>(even on cars &#8216;Made in America&#8217; because the inputs like engines and powertrain components usually come from somewhere <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-prepares-auto-tariff-announcement-as-soon-as-wednesday?srnd=homepage-americas">else</a>). Trump threatened to tariff Canada and EU even more if they decided to work <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-prepares-auto-tariff-announcement-as-soon-as-wednesday?srnd=homepage-americas">together</a>. The main goal does seem to be to push manufacturers back to the US but that&#8217;s complicated - the Big Three said &#8220;they needed more time to adapt&#8221;. <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/600-dearborn-steelworkers-to-be-laid-off-as-cleveland-cliffs-cites-weak-us-auto-production">Some steelworkers</a> were already laid off due to weak auto production. We will find out more on April 2.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sentiment</strong>: The oil and gas industry are extremely upset with Trump - if you have time, you really should read through the comments from the<a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2501#tab-comments"> Dallas Fed Energy Survey</a>. Natural gas is up 100% vs last year. Remember, we can&#8217;t do <em>anything</em> (especially AI) without energy - and this is how arguably some of the most important people in our supply chains are feeling. The uncertainty is palpable as people can&#8217;t plan for new development (much less reshore manufacturing) and it really feels like we are are all waiting in never-ending spiral of whims and wishes. Chaos is expensive! </p></li><li><p><strong>There is a continued repositioning of allies.</strong> China, Japan, and South Korea are setting up a trilateral summit. China is trying to work with <a href="https://x.com/kyleichan/status/1904511764470919604">India</a>. According to<a href="https://x.com/StevenKelly49/status/1904302491694502212"> Steven Kelly</a>, European officials are starting to war-game what could happen if they can&#8217;t rely on the Fed to provide dollar funding for swaps in times of stress. International relations are pivoting on the US is framing negotiations, not even just the substance of the deals.</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s really a lot! And today I want to talk about <em>how</em> it&#8217;s a lot - that context is increasingly more decisive than content in shaping economic outcomes, policy reactions, and cultural narratives.</p><h3>The Signal Chat Leak</h3><p>Senior Trump administration officials were discussing plans for bombing Yemen in a Signal group chat. Mike Waltz, Trump&#8217;s national security adviser, added Atlantic&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief to the chat,<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"> seemingly on accident. </a>It&#8217;s not good for many reasons, including (1) they were using a commercial app on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/25/signal-cybersecurity-trump-war-planning-00246881">their personal phones</a> to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/">discuss sensitive</a> plans<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> (2) they accidentally added a journalist (3) many members of the administration then lied when asked to explain what happened. The FT said that it could have violated the US Espionage Act - it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7d06370a-4b93-4184-85f0-60532919d7d4">careless, incompetent behavior </a>that could have put the lives of soldiers at risk if the wrong person was added.</p><p>Right now, it doesn&#8217;t seem like anyone is getting fired from the leak. Mike Waltz did take <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/waltz-apology-signal-yemen-plans-1.7493422">responsibility</a> but also denied knowing Jeffrey Goldberg. It&#8217;s very much the crystallization of how the administration interacts with the world - there of deception and to be quite honest, they seem to think that voters are stupid sometimes, (I am really not being political here, it&#8217;s just how they treat the populace) and then you turn around and you get a 25% tariff on cars from the guy you voted for to improve the economy. </p><p>But this is also a perfect crystallization of how, in our hyper-digital age, it's increasingly the <em>context</em> and framing of information (not the content itself) that drives debates and shapes economic futures. Here, the <em>content</em> of the war plans was practically overshadowed by <em>how</em> they leaked (understandably!) - the wrong platform, the journalist, and the subsequent denial. In other words, the <em>context</em> of the leak drove the story more than the actual secrets themselves.</p><h3>Abundance as an Example</h3><p>So let me flesh this out more - you can look at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Progress-Takes-Ezra-Klein/dp/1668023482">Abundance Discourse (</a>the conversation around Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson&#8217;s new book) for another example of this. A lot of people&#8230; just don&#8217;t like it. I think the book is good, with good ideas on how to build and invest and essentially provides something other than the regressive ideas that are sometimes proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/aoc-tina-smith-housing.html">(rent caps</a>, for example). The authors have faced a lot of criticism mostly because their agenda doesn&#8217;t serve microinterests (I do think Joe Weisenthal<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-24/i-want-to-believe-in-abundance"> has the most substantial critical</a> write up on it<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>). </p><p>Most critics seemingly don&#8217;t pay attention to the core idea of &#8216;Time to Actually Build&#8217; - they just argue with the <em>context</em> that Klein and Thompson have presented. Critics ignore the substance and push a blanket &#8216;capitalism bad&#8217; narrative or argue for some other tangential thing or don&#8217;t like Ezra Klein etc etc. It&#8217;s this meme - </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg" width="416" height="477.24444444444447" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1239,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:416,&quot;bytes&quot;:110619,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/159939943?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ojD0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf716d3c-9cc7-4d8f-a7f8-834f4389192b_1080x1239.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And this is where we are - <em>context</em> matters more than <em>content</em>.

But. The creator of the style, Hayao Miyazaki, thoughts on AI are neither cute nor fun. He said "I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all&#8230; it&#8217;s an insult to life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=BPl-mcsXwJHrjHCD&amp;v=ngZ0K3lWKRc&amp;feature=youtu.be">itself</a>." Which is complicated - the artist clearly doesn&#8217;t like the medium, but does the artist get a say in any of that? The content of the work <em>is</em> his, but the context in which people are sharing it <em>isn&#8217;t</em>! </p><p>What people are doing with Miyazaki&#8217;s work is very similar to a Snapchat filter - it&#8217;s really nothing new, but how people are talking about it is important. </p><p>For example, someone said &#8220;art just became accessible&#8221; in regards to being able to Ghibli-fy friends - which has layers of discussion in (1) how people think about art (2) how people think about artists (3) the intent that people have to bring art into being and (4) is AI-generated art in the style of someone else&#8217;s art actually&#8230; art?</p><ul><li><p>Art is a process and a practice and is something you spend time with, thinking about. Usually it comes from the depths of your soul, a small doodle or a poem or a song or a mural on a wall. Aesthetic and art are different - one is a path that has already been carved, the other is something new and bright and entirely personal. </p></li><li><p>Art is one of the very best things that makes us human. There are worries about the &#8216;Dead Internet Theory&#8217; - that we stop making art and music and beautiful things (I don&#8217;t think this will happen) and the AIs just end up training on old data and eventually each other and perhaps come up with new and beautiful things, but of course, can the AI<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> feel how a human feels? And can a human feel how another human felt if it&#8217;s the AI making it?</p></li></ul><p>Miyazaki&#8217;s discomfort with AI-generated art underscores a larger trend: AI doesn&#8217;t just replicate tasks - it reshapes how meaning (and thus value) is made. </p><p>And this is important because when we talk about AI's economic impact, we often fall back on familiar automation narratives: "Will robots take our jobs?" And there is evidence to the contrary - like the rise of more ATM machines actually led to <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1181062074316681216">more bank teller jobs</a> as branches became cheaper to operate. </p><p>But what is happening now isn't just automation replacing routine tasks<strong>.</strong> We really do have a restructuring of how value is created and distributed. Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily transformed physical production, AI transforms meaning-making itself, changing how we create and distribute value. The Ghibli AI trend is a perfect microcosm:</p><ol><li><p>The raw <strong>content</strong> (images) is easily reproducible and has minimal intrinsic value</p></li><li><p>The <strong>context</strong> (who shares it, how it's framed, which platforms amplify it) creates the actual economic and social value</p></li><li><p>The <strong>creators</strong> of the original style (Studio Ghibli) receive some value through "increased interest" while platforms capture the economic benefits. </p><ol><li><p>Studio Ghibli itself saw a surge in interest but captured almost none of the economic value from the trend </p></li><li><p>Platform companies (Twitter) monetized the increased engagement </p></li><li><p>AI developers gained valuable training data from millions of uploaded images</p></li><li><p>Individual users "spent" their social capital by participating in the trend</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>This pattern of value distribution - where content creators receive attention but platforms capture revenue - is clearly the dominant economic model of our digital age. </p><p>But notice how the <em>context</em> (the viral tweets, the platform hype, the novelty of AI filter) drove the phenomenon more than the <em>intrinsic value</em> of the images themselves. Once again, context overshadowed content.</p><p>But as AI accelerates our ability to (1) generate, (2) manipulate, and (3) distribute information, this weird tension becomes even more pronounced. We're entering an era where the battle between content and context will reshape how all policy is created, communicated, and understood. Digital platforms and AI tools have created an environment where:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Information volume overwhelms individual capacity to process details</strong>, making simplifying frames more influential</p></li><li><p><strong>Algorithmic curation creates personalized information environments</strong> that can reinforce certain ideas while hiding others</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-generated content can rapidly produce and distribute compelling narrative frames</strong> at unprecedented scale</p></li><li><p><strong>The collapse of traditional media gatekeepers</strong> means fewer institutional checks on misleading frames</p></li></ol><p>The result is a landscape where the <em>context</em> provided for policies (like that&#8217;s my buddy Joe Rogan talking about this, let&#8217;s listen to him) shapes their reception more powerfully than their actual content. Thorstein Veblen's concept o<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conspicuous-consumption.asp#:~:text=Conspicuous%20consumption%20is%20the%20purchase,members%20of%20a%20person's%20class.">f conspicuous consumption matters here </a>- the purchasing of goods not for their utility but for the status they display. In our digital economy, we're witnessing a shift to what might be called "conspicuous contextualization" - where value derives not from the content itself but from who frames it, where it appears, and how it's positioned.</p><p>All sorts of questions pop up here - do we develop economic systems that distribute the benefits of context creation broadly? Or will we see further concentration of power in the hands of those who control the dominant contextual frameworks?</p><p>And then the question becomes - well if economic systems get overly complex and confusing, it becomes that much easier to bend them to your will right? If democracy becomes tainted by lack of respect for truth and a force of context shaping, you can simply <a href="https://x.com/maiamindel/status/1905199129535402485">buy voters</a>, like Elon Musk is - and that&#8217;s not great. It&#8217;s confusing. </p><h4>The Theoretical Backbone</h4><p>We do have answers in the halls of history. I promise I won&#8217;t be too flowery here - our digital reality is increasingly restructuring economic and social value before our eyes. Everyone has talked about this before. We're living in what Jean Baudrillard would call a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality#:~:text=Hyperreality%20is%20the%20inability%20of,especially%20in%20technologically%20advanced%20societies."> "</a><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality#:~:text=Hyperreality%20is%20the%20inability%20of,especially%20in%20technologically%20advanced%20societies.">hyperreality</a></em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality#:~:text=Hyperreality%20is%20the%20inability%20of,especially%20in%20technologically%20advanced%20societies.">,"</a> where the distinction between the real and the simulation has collapsed, leaving us to navigate an economy of signs and symbols rather than tangible goods and services. Marshall McLuhan said many years ago that "the medium is the message." The container matters more than what's inside it.</p><p>Erving Goffman's concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frame-Analysis-Essay-Organization-Experience/dp/093035091X">frame analysis</a> is relevant here too. Goffman described how humans organize experiences through primary frameworks - the backdrop of assumptions that help us interpret events. And it gets confusing really fast, because digital technologies are are actually dismantling these frameworks because they force disparate contexts to coexist in the same spaces with little differentiation. </p><p>When military planning and cat pictures flow through identical interfaces, our brains struggle to process the appropriate context for each<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> Here, too, the real story is how the context - the platform and the feed - rearranges our sense of priority, overshadowing the substance.</p><p>Like when President Trump recently announced a 25% <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5211102-what-are-secondary-tariffs-trump-says-theyll-soon-hit-venezuela/">"secondary tariff"</a> on countries purchasing Venezuelan oil, markets reacted not just to the economic mechanics of the policy but to what the move signaled about America's geopolitical posturing, right? Whether tariffs genuinely protect domestic jobs is less relevant than the <em>signal</em> these abrupt policies send: unpredictability, potential for trade retaliation, and the sense of a fractured US approach to global commerce.</p><h3>Why Context Will Dominate</h3><p>So what does all this mean for you and me - the everyday participants in this strange new context economy? How do we navigate a world where the frame has become more valuable than what's inside it?</p><p>All these examples (the Signal chat leak, the Abundance discourse, the Ghibli AI craze, global trade) reveal a truth - we&#8217;re really not just dealing with raw content, but with the frames that shape how that content is delivered and interpreted. In each case, the platform, format, or social narrative dominated the conversation more than the actual substance. Understandably! </p><p>As AI tools make it increasingly easy to generate persuasive economic narratives, regulatory frameworks need to evolve. Current approaches focus primarily on content moderation (is the information true or false?) rather than context moderation (how is the information being framed and targeted?). We need context literacy!</p><p>We already have models for this in financial regulation, where there are strict rules about how investment opportunities can be presented to consumers. Similar principles need be applied to information more broadly. </p><p>Also, when context increasingly trumps content in determining value, we need new frameworks for understanding, measuring, and distributing that value. Power gravitates to those who control context. Ultimately, the real battle isn&#8217;t about the raw content - it&#8217;s about who defines, manipulates, and monetizes the <em>frame</em>. That&#8217;s why Trump&#8217;s tariffs, Klein and Thompson&#8217;s ideas, and Miyazaki&#8217;s art style all end up overshadowed by questions of <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> they appear, <em>who</em> is sharing them, and <em>how</em> they&#8217;re spun. </p><p>This isn&#8217;t really anything novel. But in our hyper-digital age, how information is framed often matters more than the substance of that information itself.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or recommendation for any investment.

Four interesting points seem to thread together the same story:</p><ul><li><p>The growing evidence of an antisystem mindset among young people - especially young men -rooted in a sense of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-17/gen-z-job-recession-needs-urgent-attention?sref=aGKv3aV7">futurelessness</a>.</p></li><li><p>The collision of AI and the &#8220;actual world,&#8221; torching what remains of trust (extraordinarily so, as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/44a7927b-66d7-4321-8425-08ed162a3994">documented by the FT)</a> and clarity in public discourse.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration&#8217;s moves around the so-called Mar-a-Lago accord (brilliantly covered by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fba87dd3-514a-41c2-b2b9-ea597ffbdfbf">Gillian Tett</a>).</p></li><li><p>The endgame to reshore manufacturing, spotlighted in <a href="https://x.com/aphysicist/status/1902002518869123314">recent JD Vance speech. </a></p></li></ul><p>All these developments - the antisystem youth sentiment, the AI disruptions, Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago accord moves, and attempts at reshoring - tie back to one urgent problem: no policy will really work if no one trusts in it.</p><h3>The Crisis of Futurelessness </h3><p>First, let&#8217;s talk young people. The beginning of this essay will hit on the points that many others have made, but hopefully it will provide a lens for the policy analysis part later on. For young people (honestly, many people) there is a sense of futurelessness stemming from rising costs, a stagnant labor market, and the nonstop barrage of social-media outrage. This is hardly new - many have pointed it out, <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/gen-z-and-the-end-of-predictable">including me</a> but recent pieces have hammered it home, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-17/gen-z-job-recession-needs-urgent-attention?sref=aGKv3aV7">Conor Sen</a>'s piece<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Gen Z job recession</strong>: Conor highlights a &#8220;low firing, low hiring&#8221; job market (which Jerome Powell also noted during the FOMC meeting). This dynamic might be fine for older workers, but it <em>feels</em> like a recession to new grads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic pain, now</strong>: The unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds has jumped to 8.3% (7x the deterioration seen by prime-age workers). 80% of white-collar Gen Zers say it&#8217;s difficult to find a better position, and AI threatens to replace entry-level roles they once relied on to launch their careers (and no one is really talking about what we are going to do about that).</p></li></ul><p>Young people feel a broken social contract: effort and patience no longer guarantee security or opportunity. The result is a kind of presentism (sports betting, meme trading) instead of planning for a future that feels out of reach. For a young workforce facing these barriers, it&#8217;s logical to tune out or embrace an &#8220;antisystem&#8221; candidate who at least acknowledges their desperation, reinforcing the cycle of futurelessness.

Barack Obama captured Millennials&#8217; imagination in 2008 because they wanted a break from financial-crisis-era politics. Now Trump serves that function for segments of Gen Z: <em>if you can&#8217;t see a future, drastic action feels more appealing</em>.</p><h4>Cognitive Capacity &amp; Phoneworld </h4><p>Layered on top of the economic stress is what John Burn-Murdoch calls a<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc"> cognitive crisis</a>: we aren&#8217;t getting dumber, but we can&#8217;t think as well. Our ability to maintain sustained attention, do deeper critical analysis, and solve complex problems is fried by fragmentation, especially because of social media.</p><p><a href="https://www.late-review.com/p/the-eternal-present">Kate Wagner</a> calls it &#8216;phoneworld&#8217; - a place where we&#8217;re inundated with the same news and hundreds of knee-jerk reactions, locking us in an eternal present. Meanwhile, material reality &#8211; crumbling infrastructure, economic insecurity, and declining global influence - demands serious solutions. But the constant storm of hot takes saps our capacity for nuance (you can see this in any Twitter interaction), making it easier for political actors to weaponize half-truths and reinforce distrust in any meaningful governance.</p><h4>Role Models</h4><p>Adding to the chaos is a leadership vacuum. Compare older generations of the ultra-wealthy, like Andrew Carnegie, who gave away 90% of his fortune building libraries, to the new wave of Twitter feuds and boring culture-war stunts, like the <a href="https://sherwood.news/crypto/solana-pulls-ad-after-huge-backlash/">recent Solana ad</a>. Warren Buffett is really the only outlier now, writing <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/2024ar/2024ar.pdf">in his recent shareholder letter</a> (as he discussed how much he pays in taxes): </p><blockquote><p>Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. </p><p>And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result <em>requires</em> both wisdom and vigilance on your part.</p></blockquote><p>He&#8217;s effectively telling policymakers to support those who can&#8217;t support themselves&#8212;and to avoid messing with the dollar (we&#8217;ll get to the Mar-a-Lago accord soon). It&#8217;s refreshing because we don&#8217;t see it a lot? We kind of have a lot of jerks leading the charge out there. As Trump reminded us, all of this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIoOJbtOjQI">&#8220;great television</a>&#8221; - personal vendettas and ideological grandstanding sell better than integrity or decency!</p><p>But like&#8230; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/monkeypox-research-johns-hopkins-nih-funding-vaccinated/">DOGE is slashing cancer research funding</a> rather than addressing genuine waste. That reinforces the perception that our systems are irredeemably broken. People begin to feel no one genuinely has their back (or their future) in mind. That vacuum of trustworthy leadership sets the stage for a world where political theater becomes the main act.</p><p>Sometimes when I am traveling and ask students what they're saving for, they literally laugh - it&#8217;s a very grim resignation. They don&#8217;t trust that their effort will be rewarded. Again, the pain of economic insecurity has to go somewhere and if it can&#8217;t be channeled into meaningful work or stable institutions, it festers into alienation or extremes.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>Trump Exposes Our Institutional Cracks</h3><p>And we are in the extremes, no matter how you feel about the policies. Trump recently said: </p><blockquote><p>We're doing very well right now. We're doing well because I won the election. If I didn't win the election, we would have had a very bad period. Stock market going down was because of the bad four years we had.</p></blockquote><p>This sums up the Reality TV approach to governance: endless spectacle! From threats like &#8220;Canada should be our 51st state (he keeps on<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1902146938038030484"> saying it</a> as well as threatening Greenland<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> and now Canada understandably <a href="https://x.com/truckdriverpleb/status/1901755580881981462">doesn&#8217;t want to negotiate</a>) to defying <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/noncitizens-deported-alien-enemies-act-criminal-records-ice/story?id=119912375&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">judges</a>, to dismantling <a href="https://x.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1901895935006761164">Voice of America </a>(so important in places like Ukraine, Russia, and Afghanistan), the Trump administration has tested every constitutional norm.</p><p>But. </p><p>Trump's real genius is turning governance into entertainment while simultaneously exposing the rot in our systems. This administration has shown us the weaknesses in our democracy, again, for however you feel about what they are doing. They&#8217;ve shown the cracks that partisanship has created, something George Washington would be ashamed of. They have ignored all of what makes America good, and have unfortunately focused on what makes her weak, at the cost of how young people feel about their future. </p><p>If it turns out that the Trump administration can defy direct Supreme Court precedent (84% of Americans believe he should <a href="https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1902352637447503919">follow court orders</a>) and overturn the will of Congress, then we are experiencing a true test of power - trying on the One Ring just to see what it feels like. If the Federal Reserve&#8217;s independence<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> goes too, as the<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/03/20/antitrust-advocates-trumps-ftc-firings-is-a-favor-to-his-billionaire-buddies/#:~:text=&#8220;The%20FTC%20is%20an%20independent,to%20fight%20fraudsters%20and%20monopolists."> FTC&#8217;s went </a>(likely surprising the head of the FTC, at least based on his <a href="https://x.com/nancyscola/status/1902130100398694524">recent Odd Lots interview</a>) inflation will shoot up and interest rates could spike, really pulling the rug from under the economy. </p><h4>Quick Fed Note</h4><p>The Federal Reserve decided to pause rate cuts yesterday, reiterating many times that the economic environment is extremely uncertain and they don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happening. They revised inflation and unemployment projections upward and economic growth downwards, partially due to the tariffs (which could lead to <a href="https://x.com/KevRGordon/status/1902423014291206196">stagflation</a> over time, especially if inflation goes up and economic growth flatlines). But, Jerome Powell said that any inflation caused by these tariffs would be transitory, basically saying that the Fed would look through them. </p><p> Powell&#8217;s in a tight spot, navigating an orchestrated slowdown from the administration - firing government staff (they have already had to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5318687/usda-fired-federal-employees-probationary-osc-mspb#:~:text=New%20Music%20Friday-,Nearly%206%2C000%20USDA%20workers%20fired%20by%20Trump%20to%20get%20jobs,the%20Merit%20Systems%20Protection%20Board.">rehire some of them</a>), deregulating finance, trying to delever the public sector, all while wanting the 10-year Treasury yield down. The Fed signaled that the next time they cut will be when the economy is in dire straits. President Trump didn&#8217;t quite like that, tweeting that the Fed should have cut in preparation for tariffs.</p><p>We will see what happens. But there is definitely a push for change.</p><h3>JD Vance&#8217;s Speech &amp; the Reshoring Push</h3><p>Against this backdrop of institutional strain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgoUvuyLik">JD Vance spoke at the a16z American Dynamism summit</a> about making manufacturing great again in the US. It was a relief to hear something that wasn&#8217;t pure demolition - he focused on building. His core arguments:</p><ul><li><p><strong>We can&#8217;t separate innovation from manufacturing</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration has hurt innovation</strong> (controversial, especially given how immigration historically boosts U.S. productivity and contrasts to Japan, who has very restrictive immigration policies, and hasn&#8217;t seen the same growth as the US)</p></li><li><p><strong>The U.S. is falling behind in productivity</strong>, though data generally shows we are <a href="https://x.com/ernietedeschi/status/1901704308099281193">phenomenally productive</a>.</p></li></ul><p>And to be clear, there is power in bringing manufacturing back to the United States. We desperately need another Bell Labs and another DARPA. But it&#8217;s important <em>how</em> we do it. He states that their entire <a href="https://x.com/aphysicist/status/1902002532395729153">economic package is</a>:</p><ul><li><p>Tariffs to protect domestic industries (they plan to do <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/19/trump-tariffs-imports-liberation-day/">&#8216;trillions&#8217;</a> by <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5198214-trump-pledges-reciprocal-tariffs/">April 2</a>)</p></li><li><p>Tax cuts<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> &amp; deregulation to spur investment</p></li><li><p>Lower energy costs</p></li><li><p>Strong border enforcement to curb the influx of cheap labor</p></li><li><p>Full expensing of investments.</p></li></ul><p>Some of this&#8230; is not new! </p><ul><li><p>Biden was doing similar things through federal spending, tax incentives, and public&#8211;private partnerships (e.g., the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act) as well as subsidies and direct federal outlays. </p></li><li><p>Trumponomics is more on tariffs, reducing immigration flows (especially lower-wage labor), lowering regulations, and cutting taxes. A lack of low cost labor will force innovation.</p></li></ul><p>The real question is which approach better serves <em>long-term</em> innovation. Most research suggests:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Targeted public investment</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Competitive market pressures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A skilled workforce</strong> (including <a href="https://eig.org/exceptional-by-design/">specialized immigrant labor</a>)</p></li></ol><p>&#8230; drive innovation more effectively than protectionism. But Trump is consistent: his mercantilist stance (steady since his 1987 full-page New York Times ad arguing against defending Japan <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-yes-trump-paid-030000826.html">militarily</a>) views the economy as zero-sum. Funnily enough, this contradicts Ronald Reagan's warning <a href="https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1886236815319052308">that same year: </a></p><blockquote><p>When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing... But what eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection. They stop competing and stop making innovative changes... Then, high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.</p></blockquote><p>The American shipbuilding industry is a protectionist cautionary tale - it fell behind while China surged ahead. A single Chinese state-owned shipbuilder now produces more commercial vessels by tonnage than the entire American industry has since World War II (great read from CSIS on that <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/ship-wars-confronting-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-empire">here</a>). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg" width="630" height="344.47210300429185" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:637,&quot;width&quot;:1165,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:630,&quot;bytes&quot;:138599,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/159383572?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ctpg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7af2a8e-86a4-441a-bcb8-9d24bfd0d341_1165x637.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And trade wars are EXPENSIVE. We're already distributing <a href="https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/agriculture-department-launches-10-billion-farmer-aid-program?taid=67d9b37dba43ac000151470a&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">$10b in economic loss recovery </a>payments to farmers facing trade retaliation, and Liberation Day (April 2, where we put trillions of <a href="https://x.com/byHeatherLong/status/1902374326558404985">tariffs on other countries</a>) hasn&#8217;t even arrived yet.</p><p>And would reshoring even fix everything? Alison Schrager has a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-13/tariffs-won-t-help-more-men-get-jobs"> great piece </a>about how we aren&#8217;t in the 1960s and &#8220;the blame doesn&#8217;t lie with trade.&#8221; Manufacturing jobs have declined primarily because of technology, not offshoring. The real issues are workforce training gaps and regulatory barriers, again making deregulation more effective than protectionism.</p><p>And the economic uncertainty is already visible:</p><ul><li><p>Companies aren&#8217;t investing with 6-month capital expenditure expectations falling in March to their lowest since November <a href="https://x.com/LizAnnSonders/status/1902307087578791994">2020</a></p></li><li><p>Businesses&#8217; outlooks for the next 6 months continued to deteriorate in <a href="https://x.com/LizAnnSonders/status/1902307690279309568">March</a></p></li><li><p>Industrial production skyrocketed but that&#8217;s because motor vehicle production surged as companies try to get in front of the <a href="https://x.com/LizAnnSonders/status/1902307485593059403">tariffs</a></p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s a bipartisan issue, though: we do need to <em>build here</em>, but it&#8217;s not about which party does it &#8220;better.&#8221; I am so extraordinarily sick of political parties. I appreciate Derek Thompson's point on the <a href="https://x.com/thehonestlypod/status/1902065520905429412">Honestly with Bari Weiss</a> podcast that liberal "obsession with process is getting in the way of outcomes":</p><blockquote><p>Something broke with American innovation because we over-regulated the physical and got obsessed with the digital&#8230; We have artificial intelligence that is massively brilliant... while at the same time, we can't build a train at the same speed that we did 50 or even 100 years ago.</p></blockquote><p>As Ezra Klein and Thompson argue in their<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Progress-Takes-Ezra-Klein/dp/1668023482?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;gQT=2"> book</a> "Abundance," building is always better than dismantling. The challenge, as Zach Weinberg <a href="https://x.com/zachweinberg/status/1902104034179170355">wrote</a>, is recognizing that some production simply doesn't need to happen domestically - other countries do it cheaper, alleviating price pressures. Forcing everything onshore risks creating inflationary problems, export difficulties (especially after alienating trading partners), and higher costs throughout supply chains. We can build here, but we should also believe in the free market and free trade.</p><p>For younger Americans especially, these mixed signals about manufacturing and tariffs only deepen their uncertainty about the future. If companies are hesitant to invest in long-term projects (and trade fights further erode global markets) then Gen Z is left wondering whether the system can ever offer them stable opportunities or upward mobility.</p><h3>The Mar-a-Lago Accord</h3><p>Perhaps the most consequential yet least understood aspect of Trump's economic strategy (because it isn&#8217;t quite happening as far as we know) is what Gillian Tett brilliantly unpacks as the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fba87dd3-514a-41c2-b2b9-ea597ffbdfbf">the Mar-a-Lago accord</a> - a plan to fundamentally reshape America's economic relationship with the world. </p><p>Named after Trump's Florida estate and modeled on the 1985 Plaza Accord (when major economies coordinated to devalue the dollar), this strategy aims to devalue the US dollar to boost American manufacturing competitiveness. The underlying belief is that the global trade system unfairly burdens American workers while benefiting financial elites. From what I gather, these are the key components:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Dollar Devaluation</strong> &#8211; Lowering the dollar&#8217;s value to make U.S. exports cheaper and help domestic manufacturers compete internationally (despite alienating allies)</p></li><li><p><strong>Tariff Implementation</strong> &#8211; Imposing (many) taxes on imported goods to protect domestic industries and gain leverage over trade partners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Debt Restructuring</strong> &#8211; Swapping Treasuries for perpetual dollar bonds, reducing immediate obligations and freeing up fiscal space for tax cuts and other spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sovereign Wealth Fund</strong> &#8211; Creating a state-run investment vehicle to direct capital into strategic industries</p></li><li><p><strong>Capital Flow Taxes</strong> &#8211; Taxing cross-border capital movements to control speculation and maintain leverage in international financial markets.</p></li></ol><p>The Trump administration doesn&#8217;t want to be the &#8220;defender of the free world.&#8221; They see the dollar as too strong and global trade as rigged against Main Street, as Trinh Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/Trinhnomics/status/1902187129603858715">highlighted</a>. Tariffs become a tool to force allies into compliance, while a weaker dollar boosts exports. They also hope to make China focus inward (though China is moving at the literal <a href="https://x.com/jenzhuscott/status/1902026109333762225">speed of light</a>). But there are a few headwinds: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of international cooperation:</strong> Unlike the original Plaza Accord, which required coordination with allies, the Mar-a-Lago approach is unilateral and confrontational, perhaps forcing people to join. But Germany has already established a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80742c32-1af3-4881-a935-f3045df12b12">massive</a> &#8364;500 billion infrastructure fund - equivalent to a <a href="http://&#8364;">$3T</a> American investment when adjusted for GDP. The European Union is excluding the United States from their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb9e0ddc-8606-46f5-8758-a1b8beae14f1">&#8364;150bn rearmament fund.</a> Canada plans to <a href="https://x.com/MatinaStevis/status/1902443426626376172">join</a>. </p><ul><li><p>Investors are grimacing - fund managers are rotating out of <a href="https://x.com/Barchart/status/1902179390076940676">US stocks</a> at a record pace into Chinese and European alternatives.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Currency Contradictions:</strong> Tariffs generally strengthen a currency, so trying to devalue the dollar at the same time is tricky. Debt restructuring, such as swapping Treasuries for perpetual bonds, risks undermining the dollar&#8217;s global reserve status.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alienating trade partners:</strong> The plan assumes partners will endure tariffs to retain U.S. market access. But the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/13/business/walmart-china-investigation-us-tariffs-intl-hnk/index.html">Walmart</a>&#8211;China standoff shows Beijing is prepared to protect its interests. European allies are also forming alternative economic frameworks. Lockheed Martin is <a href="https://x.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1902449586532130987">already showing signs of strain</a> because of the damage inflicted by the movement of money and erratic US leadership. </p></li></ul><p>The US isn&#8217;t the &#8220;big dog&#8221; anymore and might not be able to force other countries to play our game. As<a href="https://x.com/stevehou0/status/1902700043330568268"> Steve Hou said: </a></p><blockquote><p>The the essential contradiction is what they are trying to do takes time, broad buy-in, continuity to succeed and have anything genuine to show for, which is not how they are approaching it. Trump doesn&#8217;t do patient. He&#8217;s a good promoter though that he&#8217;ll point to something that&#8217;s not really a big victory and say it is and keep repeating it until it&#8217;s believed</p></blockquote><p>China, for its part, is offering an opposite blueprint: they&#8217;re investing heavily in domestic consumption and social safety nets, not slashing spending. Their <a href="https://x.com/wstv_lizzi/status/1901231971805610265">"Consumption Boosting Action Plan"</a> spans wage increases, expanded welfare, and strategic market interventions across multiple sectors - even offering consumer loans with 60-second approvals. We will see who wins. </p><p>The reason the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/china-markets-to-outperform-wall-street-as-american-exceptionalism-pauses.html?taid=67da6e50ba43ac0001515daf&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Chinese stock market is booming</a> is because the government plans to support industry, rather than abandon it. China is methodically building a different economic vision that could reshape global power dynamics. </p><p>The US doesn&#8217;t have the cards right now to tell them what to do.</p><p>Trump's assertion that Russia "would like to have <a href="https://x.com/tahrajirari/status/1902159759673061662">some of our economic power</a>" while claiming they <a href="https://x.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1902076901667303452">agreed to a ceasefire </a>(which they hadn&#8217;t, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/putin-spurns-ukraine-ceasefire-in-talks-but-trump-calls-it-a-win?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business">at least according to Putin</a>) reveals this too - we have torched pretty solid trade relationships to ally with economic and administrative weaknesses. Turkey is already going <a href="https://x.com/AyseZarakol/status/1902241066868171259">off the rails</a> partly because there is no international guard dog - the US has stepped away.</p><p>Again, none of this is lost on the young population. If the rules of international trade can change on a dime - and if currency devaluation, tariffs, or sovereign wealth schemes gamble with economic stability - then for a 23-year-old just entering the workforce, it&#8217;s yet another reason to doubt that &#8220;playing by the rules&#8221; will pay off.</p><h3>Rebuilding Cognitive Capacity and Trust</h3><p>Welp. How do we get young people to buy into a future again? It&#8217;s bigger than just policy tweaks. We need to rebuild trust in institutions, strengthen our cognitive capacity like John Burn-Murdoch wrote to parse complex information, and give people real opportunities to do meaningful work. AI, social media, and the &#8220;eternal present&#8221; of <em>phoneworld</em> intensify cynicism, but we can counteract it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Education Reform with Measurable Results:</strong> Louisiana's education transformation offers a helpful blueprint. By implementing the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5304415/louisiana-reading">Science of Reading, </a>establishing clear accountability metrics, and investing in teacher training, they boosted literacy rankings from 50th to 16th nationally.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Literacy as Infrastructure:</strong> Finland has successfully countered misinformation through thei<a href="https://www.institutfrancais.com/en/magazine/interview/mikko-salo-founder-of-faktabaari-on-the-challenges-of-information-and-media">r "Faktabaari" (Fact Bar) program</a>, teaching students to evaluate information sources critically. Estonia has integrated digital citizenship into their core curriculum since 2012, producing demonstrably higher <a href="https://www.institutfrancais.com/en/magazine/interview/mikko-salo-founder-of-faktabaari-on-the-challenges-of-information-and-media">media literacy rates. </a>The U.S. could adopt similar methods without huge new spending (perhaps challenging in Reality TV governance land) </p></li></ul><p>The path forward requires both technological innovation and social renewal. </p><p>No dollar strategy or manufacturing initiative can succeed without this foundation of shared purpose and cognitive resilience. Our challenge now isn't just to reshape trade policies or educational systems, but to rebuild the belief that working toward a common future is worth the effort (the Klein and Thompson Abundance agenda does a good job of this, in my opinion). Until we meet that challenge, gold prices will keep rising on uncertainty, antisystem sentiment will keep growing, and the sense of futurelessness will continue to define a generation.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

Meanwhile, social media has so thoroughly warped our perception of time that we can no longer process events in a coherent timeline - there&#8217;s even a chart for it!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg" width="578" height="395.4483333333333" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:578,&quot;bytes&quot;:79068,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/158735653?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZSpO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bf87ff4-9a59-4ece-982a-c89db271bf76_1200x821.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Via <a href="https://x.com/DavidBeckworth/status/1899091666742473053">David Beckworth</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Let&#8217;s discuss. </p><h3>Time, Tariffs, and Anxiety</h3><p>The fact that we can&#8217;t exist in linear time not really surprising. Many people have talked about this, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/books/present-shock-by-douglas-rushkoff.html">like Douglas Rushkoff in Present Shock</a> (the NYT described the book as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/books/present-shock-by-douglas-rushkoff.html">making</a> &#8220;sense of what we already half-know&#8221;), <a href="https://mascontext.com/issues/information/its-not-information-overload-its-filter-failure">Clay Shirky and filter failure</a>, etc etc. But it is <em>very</em> apparent right now. </p><p>The tariff situation is walking back and forth along our economic spine, bones cracking with stress and uncertainty. After all, <em>when</em> are they going to happen? <em>What</em>?<em>Why</em>? <em>How</em> can Americans possibly recalibrate their career plans, investments, or family budgets quickly enough to match the pace of change?</p><p>They really can't. Each headline barely registers (maybe we text it to a friend, stare at the phone in dismay, sigh a bit) before being buried under tomorrow's (or the next hours) crisis. That impossibility in the face of constant change breeds either</p><ol><li><p><strong>Anxiety</strong> ("I'm falling behind!") or </p></li><li><p><strong>Numbed resignation</strong> ("Whatever, I can't keep up"). </p></li></ol><p>Neither response builds the focused, patient civic engagement that functioning democracies require, and who can blame anyone for feeling this way. And naturally, our collective attention span becomes fragmented, incapable of following any single thread to completion. <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1899289704945885531"> </a>We text our friends a question, forget to respond. We make plans, then cancel. It&#8217;s not just us as a collective populace - it&#8217;s our leaders too. They get on TV with <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1899289704945885531">largely half-remembered arguments.</a> We exist in a state of perpetual half-conclusion, where nothing is ever fully processed before the next urgent matter demands attention. </p><p>And that&#8217;s the state of the information ecosystem. It&#8217;s all half done.</p><h4>Tariff Volatility </h4><p>Tariffs are half done too.

<a href="https://x.com/Fritschner/status/1899543089376612630">revoke Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a> (remember, Trump is using emergency powers under the guise of fentanyl and border security to enact these tariffs - Congress is the real body of power that has tariff authority). This could increase his ability to set tariffs and create even more trade and stability issues.</p><p>And if you zoom out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana">Pax Americana</a> - that grand postwar project of American leadership - was built on two fundamental qualities we're now losing domestically: (1) patience and (2) focus. The Marshall Plan wasn't designed for immediate returns; NATO wasn't constructed overnight; global reserve currency status wasn't achieved in a news cycle! These were multi-generational projects requiring sustained, methodical attention - precisely the kind of commitment to time our frenetic information ecosystem now makes nearly impossible.</p><p>But what created this environment?</p><h3>Bots: Reality Collapse Online</h3><p>I think bots are one of the most underdiscussed problems we have, partially because they are so difficult to track. We don&#8217;t know how many bots are out there (although there do seem to be sprawling networks that get millions of views, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/09/x-twitter-bots-republican-primary-debate-tweets-increase">Timothy Graham has documented</a>). But as Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/09/x-twitter-bots-republican-primary-debate-tweets-increase">himself said </a></p><blockquote><p>It is impossible to tell with unverified accounts whether you&#8217;re dealing with a small or large number of real people, as sophisticated bots are virtually indistinguishable from humans.</p></blockquote><p>So according to Graham&#8217;s research, 1,300 bots garnered about 3 million views during the first Republican primary debate in 2023. They create all sorts of divisiveness, like spreading conspiracy theories (the Springfield cat situation) and harassing certain people (they like to get in my comments a lot). It&#8217;s very difficult to track bots, but their prevalence and usually strange pattern of speech make it certain that they are there.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

it bluntly: "I'm supposed to be bidding on projects that will finish in 2028, but I have no idea what materials will cost next month, let alone next year. I can&#8217;t see straight." Behind the abstract economic statistics are real people making real decisions with increasingly little information to go on.</p><p>But - maybe we reshore everything back to the United States and all the jobs return and everyone fired gets rehired and it&#8217;s perfect - the problem then, is no one will want to trade with us.

Since then many others have called this an attempt to <em>Volcker</em> the economy - intentionally apply immense pressure to economy. Here, the administration seems to want to slow the economy so rates drop, debt gets refinanced, etc. </p><p>Trump and Musk seem to be copying Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, who came in with a literal chainsaw to help revive the Argentinian economy. It worked. But the US is not Argentina. As TS Lombard wrote: </p><blockquote><p>Musk&#8217;s short-term-pain/long-term-gain thesis owes a lot to his chainsaw-wielding hero Javier Milei. Argentina introduced stinging austerity measures after Milei's election victory in December 2023, basically by freezing government spending while inflation was running in triple digits. After a brief recession, the economy has already started to recover &#8211; much faster than anyone expected. Inflation is coming down, and Argentina has swapped twin deficits for twin surpluses. </p><p>Milei's chainsaw worked! But copying the policies of a country that had massive endemic corruption and was on the brink of hyperinflation is, er, problematic. The public readily accepted Milei&#8217;s nasty medicine (they explicitly voted for it) and any chance of an economic revival had to start by crushing inflation. Confidence couldn&#8217;t return when inflation was running at 200+%. The US is in a very different situation. Yes, inflation is a bit high, but not so high that Musk and co should deliberately engineer a recession.</p></blockquote><p>There is economic pain in the US, especially in the form of structural affordability, with the high cost of housing, childcare, and eldercare. And naturally, there's energy for tearing down institutions (and doing it haphazardly, for however you feel about the policies) and norms (without understanding why those norms exist), but precious little for the patient, methodical work of building new structures, communities, or systems to replace them. It&#8217;s just Wreck-it Ralph, except we are wrecking the 80 years of peace and prosperity many fought for, and many died for. </p><h4>Alternatives to a Recession</h4><p>The result is a swirling chaos (endless headlines, ephemeral crises) that yields no real new institutions or stable communities. It makes more sense to blow up an economy that wasn&#8217;t working, but the US economy (even with its problems) was doing okay. When Trump was asked about a Recession<a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1898887654399463667">, he responded with</a>: </p><blockquote><p>We&#8217;re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we&#8217;re going to become so rich, you&#8217;re not going to know where to spend the money</p></blockquote><p>Which is right, if we destroy all our trade relationships, we won&#8217;t know where to spend that money. I will recognize that there is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/09/trump-recession-tariffs-2025-economy-00220016">truth in some of what Trump has messaged</a>. He said:</p><blockquote><p>What I have to do is build a strong country. You can&#8217;t really watch the stock market. If you look at China they have a hundred-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters. And you can't go by that. You have to do what's right. </p></blockquote><p>Yes! The US is very well-known for short-term thinking. And thinking long-term could do us some good, especially in trade relationships. But what Trump seems to be hinting at is the idea that a Recession is necessary, that Americans should ignore what they're experiencing <em>now</em> for some promised <em>future</em> prosperity. But we don&#8217;t need a <strong>recession</strong> to fix the economy. <a href="https://x.com/besttrousers/status/1898139054899679381">Matt Darling:</a></p><blockquote><p>Recessions are not a necessary part of the business cycle that lead to further improvements later.

But as Henry Grabar wrote in his review, talking about these things know feels &#8220;like discussing how you&#8217;d like to redecorate your house while your neighbors strip the copper wiring from your walls". But - there&#8217;s a path.</p></li></ul><p>There&#8217;s always the opportunity to expand, improve economic functionality, basically, make things better slowly, versus alternating between Very Bad and Very Good, especially if we are thinking in one hundred year cycles. But there is a difference between capability and capacity. </p><p>There is no promise the path to slowdown will work either. Olivier Blanchard <a href="https://x.com/ojblanchard1/status/1899377531632980291">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The reason for the apparent slowdown is extreme policy uncertainty, which is leading consumers to worry, firms to wait to invest, and demand to fall. In exchange for nothing particularly good in the future. Just a pure loss.</p></blockquote><p>The recession rhetoric often suggests that current generations must experience pain for future generations to thrive which is again rooted in compressed time perception. In reality, economic harm absolutely reverberates through generations rather than "resetting" things. Just look at 2008. Many millennials <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">have barely recovered.</a></p><p>Destruction can leave room for creation, but you still have to <em>create</em>. And there is something being created - right alongside the real economy.</p><h3>The Parallel Economy: Profiting from Division</h3><p>Bloomberg has<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-10/donald-trump-jr-and-1789-capital-have-big-plans-for-maga-investing"> a terrific writeup on 1789 Capital,</a> the investment firm that Trump Jr joined instead of joining the White House. However - he did <em>join</em> the White House in <em>joining</em> 1789 Capital- he is &#8220;tapping into the MAGA ecosystem&#8221; and &#8220;monetizing his father&#8217;s vision for America&#8221; by sniffing out &#8220;the true MAGA faithful&#8221; to build this parallel economy which are &#8220;right-wing ventures that position themselves as alternatives to mainstream businesses&#8221;. </p><p>So this is essentially an attempt to build an economy for the true MAGAs, who in the short-term, can capitalize on cultural grievances, and in the long-term, potentially can build some sort of infrastructure to consolidate economic power during the recovery. </p><p>It will be a tough road - 1789 is apparently attempting to raise about $5b which is pennies compared to the $30T real economy. But it&#8217;s interesting as a project because they are - </p><ul><li><p>Creating ideologically-aligned financial institutions to replace traditional banking</p></li><li><p>Investing in companies that position themselves as "anti-woke" alternatives</p></li><li><p>Using cultural signaling (like the Happy Dad seltzer) to attract consumers</p></li><li><p>Leveraging Trump Jr.'s massive social media presence to direct attention</p></li></ul><p>&#8202;What 1789 Capital is trying to accomplish is a world where economic participation becomes an extension of identity politics. And if you go and watch that Sam Seder video, you can see that there is emotional investment in cultural division, meaning that there is appetite for consumer facing ventures that align politics with consumption. </p><ul><li><p><strong>It hasn&#8217;t worked.</strong> The companies in this universe haven&#8217;t done too well so far - the right-wing version of YouTube, Rumble, is down 18% since their IPO, the anti-woke marketplace PublicSquare is down 73% and Truth Social, Trump Media &amp; Technology group is extremely volatile. </p></li></ul><p>But when economic understanding takes a back seat to cultural grievance, it doesn&#8217;t matter. The narrative does! </p><p>A form of this happened in 1990s Russia, where the oligarchs essentially took over and plundered the wealth from a system, leaving the masses in destitute. There was gatekeeping of political connection, shock therapy, and a suffering endured by the public for the promise (and never actualized) economic prosperity.</p><p>But this path makes a lot of sense. If you destabilize mainstream economic structures while simultaneously building alternative ones, you create perfect conditions for people to accept unfavorable terms. Feelings of despair in America now peak in our youth. It didn't used to be this way. People are feeling immense amounts of pain, all set to be worsened by a downturn. Capitalizing on that via political alignment makes sense - I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good, but it makes sense.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg" width="648" height="442.26" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:648,&quot;bytes&quot;:76525,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/i/158735653?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ju5B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf51235-9ce8-408e-b747-aca85c888196_1200x819.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A parallel economy that places ideology above market clearing prices is probably not the best model to address that despair. Ideally, we&#8217;d see free markets, encourage home building (not enact tariffs that make that harder) and set ideology to the side so the economy can truly prosper. But - polarization is too profitable.</p><p>And it&#8217;s hurting us domestically, and on the global stage.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Pax Americana: Global Cost of Domestic Chaos</h2><p>Like I said earlier, we are witnessing the gradual unwinding of <em>Pax Americana - </em>the<em> </em>grand postwar project of American leadership. For decades, American economic, military, and cultural hegemony created a relatively stable international system. That system is now visibly (intentionally) fraying, adding another layer of uncertainty to our already chaotic experience of daily life.</p><p>The reductive tactical thinking of &#8220;beat down our buddies and everyone else&#8221; is a system that prioritizes immediate victories over building anything sustainable. As America retreats from investments in literally anything that isn&#8217;t anti-woke and whatnot, competitors are accelerating their investment in tech, science, AI, etc. The global system is splintering, and each region is bracing for a more self-reliant future. </p><ul><li><p><strong>China</strong> is still battling deflationary winds but investing heavily (and chatting up our old allies). They have announced a trillion RMB ($138 billion) long-term national venture capital fund while simultaneously dominating renewable energy manufacturing across solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles. Their massive investments suggest they plan to emerge the sole victor of an era defined by confusion elsewhere. They have their own version of Starlink,<a href="https://x.com/mybroadband/status/1899023141126430972"> which they are launching in over 30 countries. </a>Their biotech sector is booming, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/69OgbGyZ7gmDjXRn5k0i0v?si=7df8ed8fdf4f45b9">as Odd Lots covered.</a> Nuclear physicist Liu Chang, who was instrumental in <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3301674/princeton-nuclear-physicist-liu-chang-leaves-us-china-fusion-energy-quest">helping the US achieve fusion energy</a> has left Princeton to return to Beijing. And China and Europe will also work <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3301931/open-source-model-why-france-wants-work-closely-china-ai">closely together on AI. </a></p><ul><li><p>China has positioned itself as an alternative center of gravity, with President Xi proposing "a community with a shared future for mankind" while steadily expanding economic influence across continents. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>European</strong> firms like ASML continue to dominate key semiconductor manufacturing technologies, and the region&#8217;s renewed path to defense spending has turbocharged R&amp;D (despite<a href="https://x.com/darioperkins/status/1899039709537431843"> headwinds</a>). While the U.S. is busy slashing its own CHIPS Act, Europe is (albeit, forced to) quietly carve out a leadership role in the very fields that promise the jobs of the future. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3214157-639b-4743-ab29-9af662d47ec5">2/3rds of arms imported by European members of NATO</a> were from the US - which will change. </p></li></ul><p>These shifts mark the logical extension of our domestic surrender to digital fabrications of reality! Just as the distracted, overwhelmed American consumer increasingly retreats into algorithmically-curated realities, America as a nation now responds to digital simulations rather than material conditions. The bots are helping to shape these types of policy, and we are seeing the consequences of that.</p><p>The U.S. dollar's status as the world's dominant reserve currency &#8211; long taken for granted &#8211; faces new pressures as policy volatility increases. The reserve currency is based on rule of law and stability, which is quickly disappearing. The United States has been added to the CIVICUS Monitor Watchlist due to <a href="https://time.com/7266334/us-human-rights-watchlist-civil-liberties/">declining civil liberties</a>, as there have been severe encroachments of power, including the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, who played a big role in in the Columbia protests last year. Trump is demanding that universities purge students who disagree with him. For however you feel about what Khalil did - the precedent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/627185/columbia-ice-arrest-mahmoud-khalil-palestine-protest-surveillance">this sets is extremely dangerous</a> for &#8216;free speech&#8217; - and for stability and low corruption&#8230; and for the USD.</p><p>The current erosion of Pax Americana is the result of a global hegemon becoming unmoored from any sense of material reality, partially because bots are flooding the information streams. Right now, digital simulations, not human experience, are driving national decisions. The same AI-powered bots flooding your Twitter feed are unraveling the fabric of global order by manufacturing outrage and polarization. It&#8217;s narrative warfare. </p><h3>Things Move Quickly</h3><p>This works because it exploits vulnerabilities in how we process information and time. </p><ul><li><p>When everything happens at tweet speed, a deliberately engineered recession can be sold as a quick "detox" rather than years of real human suffering. </p></li><li><p>When bots flood our information ecosystem with tribal signaling rather than factual understanding, we lose our capacity to evaluate economic claims critically. </p></li><li><p>When a parallel economy offers ideological shelter from the storm, it creates the perfect conditions for capital extraction under the mustache-and-glasses disguise of cultural alignment.</p></li></ul><p>I am still traveling quite a bit (I write to you today from NYC, yesterday Miami, tomorrow Chicago) and the conversations I am having are with a tired, tired population. I was invited salsa dancing by a very kind Uber driver in Miami, and it reminded me of how easy it is to get lost in <em>this</em>, and it's designed for us to get lost. It's flooding the zone. It works! Even if it isn&#8217;t strategic, it&#8217;s wearing everyone down. </p><p>Building something better requires more than just the negative space left by torn-down structures. It requires the patient, deliberate work of construction&#8212;the very thing our bot-driven, temporally dysphoric culture makes increasingly difficult. We have to reestablish our relationship with time, which is an essay for a different day.</p><p>But it&#8217;s possible. People like Klein and Thompson are creating a blueprint to follow. We just have to separate ideology from economic participation - which things like the parallel economy will make much more complicated. But profiting from ideology only works for the few that can sow that division - not for everyone else. We also need to fix the bot problem - the United States is an incredible place and I love it very deeply - and it deserves more than destruction via social media.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or recommendation for any investment.

As Trump said in his speech on<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/canada-won-t-scrap-tariffs-unless-all-us-levies-are-lifted-official-says"> Tuesday night before</a> Congress:</p><blockquote><p>Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it&#8217;s happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There&#8217;ll be a little disturbance, but we&#8217;re OK with that. It won&#8217;t be much.</p></blockquote><p>We're now looking at a 25% tax on Mexican imports, 25% on Canadian imports (except energy at 10%), and 20% on Chinese imports, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico?srnd=homepage-americas">most of which will be shouldered by the US consumer.</a> Joey Politano (one of the best) wrote a <a href="https://www.apricitas.io/p/trumps-blockade-of-america">detailed write up here</a>.

There is a lot of speculation in the piece - but layered on top is the rapid rise of AI, which could either amplify or undermine the administration&#8217;s economic strategy.</p><p>Throughout the halls of history, a bell has been rung that cannot be unrung over the past several weeks.

More importantly, have also vehemently retorted against the tariffs, <a href="https://x.com/MFA_China/status/1896904623589621816">stating</a>, <em>&#8220;If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we&#8217;re ready to fight till the end.&#8221;</em> Which is alarming. </p></li><li><p><strong>The European Union</strong> is likely next on Trump's list, with him threatening 25% tariffs "on cars and all other things" arriving from the 27-nation bloc, which he characterized as "formed to screw" the US.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the US,</strong> Trump has also told American farmers to &#8216;get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold inside the United States&#8217; which is troubling because (1) Trump spent $28B subsidizing farmers for the much smaller tariff impacts <a href="https://x.com/devahaz/status/1896710866718134470">in his first term</a> and (2) the US imports about 80% of the potash used to fertilize American farms from Canada. They can&#8217;t just start making stuff here all the sudden.</p></li></ul><p>There is an assumption from Republican representatives that their constituents will "do what it takes" to support the<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1896774667832049873"> president's policies on tariffs</a> and that it will just &#8220;take a little patience on the front end&#8221; which does feel like a lot to ask people who voted for Trump because he promised to ease their economic pain. </p><p>Young people are turning away from him for this very reason (support for Trump handling of the economy among young men slipped -14 points between mid-January and mid-February) <a href="https://puck.news/is-trump-already-losing-the-trump-bros/">via a report from Puck News</a>. The Republicans have also stopped doing town halls, which is the exact opposite of what an elected representative of the public should be<a href="https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1896935824014680156"> doing right now.</a></p><p>And to provide a counterargument here (although there isn&#8217;t much of one - most research does point to broad-based tariffs being harmful, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566253">just look at what happened to McKinley</a>) - there might be some improvement to domestic manufacturing, but considering almost every industry imports something from abroad, the improvements will be slim and at a great cost to the rest of the economy. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

There are several strategic reasons that become clearer when you look at the bigger picture:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Political timing: </strong>If a recession hits now, the recovery could be timing perfectly for the 2028 election cycle. Create a slump now, rebuild later, and take credit for the recovery just in time for reelection campaigns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market dynamics.</strong> A recession would force the Federal Reserve to aggressively cut interest rates, potentially boosting real estate and financial markets after an initial downturn (Trump is a real estate man, after all). </p><ol><li><p>As mentioned, Bessent has actually said they're "focused on increasing the desirability of Treasuries" - a recession would help achieve exactly that by driving investors to safe-haven assets. </p></li><li><p>This might explain why Trump's <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-says-americans-should-farm-chickens-combat-egg-prices-2039178">Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins </a>suggested that the solution to high egg prices is for Americans to "get some chickens and raise them in your backyard&#8221; (great during a bird flu). There is no plan other than a slowdown, and no sign of aid if the slowdown comes. </p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Budget strategy</strong>. An economic downturn provides justification for cutting social programs like Medicaid and SNAP benefits while simultaneously pushing through $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. In a growing economy, these cuts would seem contradictory, but in a downturn, they can be framed as "necessary austerity" and tax cuts can be seen as &#8220;freeing up capital&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>The ideology of creative destruction.</strong> The administration seems to be pursuing (rather haphazardly, even if you agree with the policies) the idea that you must tear down existing structures to build something new. We've heard this rhetoric with phrases like "drain the swamp" and "dismantle the deep state." In economic terms, it means deliberately breaking down economic structures to rebuild them according to your preferred vision.</p></li></ol><p>Looking at the broader strategy at play, what's becoming evident is a profound ideological split within American capitalism itself. One group &#8211; now ascendant in the administration (like those involved with the<a href="https://x.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1896529323160637675"> crypto strategic reserve</a>) &#8211; appears to be using this moment of global uncertainty to deliberately create economic turbulence. In this worldview, short-term economic pain isn't just an acceptable cost; it's a necessary cleansing mechanism to reset the economy toward this nationalist vision.</p><p>When administration officials talk about "reprivatizing the economy" or making Treasury bonds more "desirable," they're reframing what would typically be seen as economic contraction as something aspirational. As Ben Carlson meme&#8217;d - &#8220;It's all about messaging when you try to destroy the economy: they're not "crashing the economy" &#8211; they're "lowering mortgage rates&#8217;&#8221;. They're not "triggering inflation" &#8211; they're "reshoring American manufacturing." It's a perspective that treats economic suffering as a form of tough medicine rather than a policy failure (good ol&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory#:~:text=The%20Austrian%20business%20cycle%20theory,back%20towards%20their%20former%20uses.">ABCT</a>).</p><p>So basically, </p><p><em>10Y yields go down, stocks go down, everything goes down, economy slows, the debt gets refinanced, the Federal Reserve has to cut rates, then everything explodes upwards again, and boom.

If people don&#8217;t know which way is up or down, then it&#8217;s very difficult to make any sort of decision. This path assumes a lot out of the American public, and assumes a lot of goodwill from others.</p><h3>This Path Makes a Lot of Assumptions</h3><p>We don&#8217;t really have a lot of goodwill. Alienating allies is a good way to 1) end up alone and 2) dislodge the dollar as reserve currency. Katie Martin at the FT wrote a great article <a href="https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/error-pages/expired-link?contentId=4ba5c22a-4cf7-4ece-9bbd-4f8df6bb0071">here</a> about how desperate investors are to get away from the United States at the moment. Julia Coronado pointed out the following as an erosion of <a href="https://x.com/GregDaco/status/1896925536821420357">USD hegemony: </a></p><ol><li><p>Erosion of rule of law referring to cuts to government contracts </p></li><li><p>Undermining R&amp;D research, innovation &amp; services economy </p></li><li><p>Mar-a-Lago accord of devaluating $ and issuing non marketable long-term debt (illiquid markets)</p></li></ol><p>If we lose reserve currency status, none of these games will matter that much. </p><p>Germany is already building out their defense, with a 500 billion 10Y fund for investment, all defense spending above 1% of GDP <a href="https://x.com/SanderTordoir/status/1897078783410405584">not counted for the debt brake</a>, and a big commitment to building out, mostly because the US cannot be trusted.</p><p>So we have an economic slowdown, orchestrated or otherwise, but the mindset around the slowdown represents a profound shift in how we think about economic management. We are moving away from stability as a primary goal toward volatility as a tool for transformation. For those of us who will live through the consequences, it's a high-stakes experiment with our economic future.</p><h3><strong>The AI Thing</strong></h3><p>But. </p><p>Ezra Klein had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ben-buchanan.html">very interesting interview</a> with Ben Buchanan, the AI adviser for Biden, that essentially boiled down to &#8220;AGI is here and it&#8217;s going to disrupt everything as we know it&#8221;. He states:</p><blockquote><p>"I think we are on the cusp of an era in human history that is unlike any of the eras we have experienced before. It's not web3. It's not vaporware. A lot of what we're talking about is already here."</p></blockquote><p>So on one hand, we have an administration deliberately rewiring America's economic relationships with the world through tariffs and deglobalization. On the other, we face the emergence of AI systems capable of performing most cognitive tasks better than humans.</p><p>Both reflect a shift away from the global systems that defined the post-Cold War era toward something more fragmented, more nationalist, and potentially more volatile.</p><p>And so if one wished, one could argue that the administration's focus on deglobalization through whatever they keep doing creates some sort of economic space for technological transformation (aka a forced recession would force companies to restructure supply chains, rethink labor costs, accelerate automation, and create room for AI). </p><p>Meanwhile, the technological revolution promises productivity gains that could theoretically offset the economic drag from deglobalization. It's not merely a recession, it's a <em>sparkling reconfiguration of the labor market in preparation for an AI-driven economy.</em> The six-to-twelve-month timeline mentioned by the Bessent aligns well with projections for major AI advancements.</p><p>But - counterarguments and grounding - the CHIPS Act&#8217;s cancellation may undercut American leadership in AI hardware, given that advanced semiconductors are critical to training and running large-scale AI models. So. It is murky.</p><p>The national security dimension of all of this cannot be overlooked. As Buchanan observes: "I do think there are profound economic, military and intelligence capabilities that would be downstream of getting to AGI... And I do think it is fundamental for US national security that we continue to lead in AI." </p><p>So. Maybe that&#8217;s the plan. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://kyla.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3><strong>Navigating the Economic Uncertainty</strong></h3><p>So what does all this mean for your money? None of this is investment advice, just thoughts. We're entering what investors call a "positioning moment" &#8211; where the landscape is changing quickly enough that conventional wisdom needs reassessment. Consider:</p><ol><li><p>Stable funds could be a good option if you&#8217;re worried about the volatility. </p></li><li><p>Gold is hitting new highs, European equities outperforming American ones by 10% (and likely will continue to do so, based on Germany&#8217;s move), the flight to defensive sectors&#8230; etc. Markets are pricing in turbulence that official projections won't acknowledge. There is value in diversification always, but especially now.</p></li><li><p>Look for companies with pricing power, low dependence on imported components, and minimal exposure to retaliatory tariffs. They are positioned very differently than those caught in cross-border supply chains. This isn't just about whether stocks go up or down &#8211; it's about which segments of the economy are being structurally advantaged or disadvantaged by this policy direction. Pay attention to those companies. </p></li></ol><p>I don't know exactly how the next year will unfold. Perhaps it all works, and I certainly hope for the best. Economic systems are complex, and speculation is humbling! But I do know we're watching a high-stakes reconfiguration of economic relationships that will create both vulnerability and opportunity. How we position ourselves within that landscape &#8211; thoughtfully, deliberately, with clear eyes about what's actually happening rather than what we wish was happening &#8211; matters now more than ever.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p>There's a worldview taking shape through these decisions that sees economic integration as weakness and disruption as strength. It's a vision that places nationalist economic ambition above the stability that most economic policy has aimed for in recent decades. The key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Tariffs cause short-term disruption and broader global mistrust.</p></li><li><p>The administration appears to be pushing an intentional slowdown to engineer a reconfiguration.</p></li><li><p>AI acts as an accelerant to or partial justification for these moves.</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s a mismatch between &#8220;economic nationalism&#8221; rhetoric and who benefits in practice.</p></li></ul><p>The human costs of this experiment will be distributed unevenly. When we talk about "recessions" in the abstract, we lose sight of what they actually mean: families making impossible choices between medication and food, young graduates sending out hundreds of resumes without response, small businesses that represented decades of work closing their doors.</p><p>The difference this time is artificial intelligence. Previous economic restructurings could rely on human adaptability across generations. This transformation is happening alongside technological changes that could fundamentally alter what human labor is worth. The timeline mentioned &#8211; six to twelve months before this becomes "Trump's economy" &#8211; aligns well with projections for major AI breakthroughs that Ezra Klein describes as "an era in human history unlike any we have experienced before." Whether this administration&#8217;s hard reset will position the US as a global AI leader or weaken the country&#8217;s competitiveness in the face of rising powers remains an open question.</p><p>And economic systems do exist to serve human needs, not the other way around. When we start treating market turbulence as therapeutic (as a necessary cleansing rather than a failure of management) we've inverted this relationship entirely. We've put the system above the people it's meant to serve.</p><p>The promise was economic nationalism that would benefit American workers. The reality we're seeing unfold is policy that's likely to hurt those same workers while primarily benefiting those with enough money to weather the storm and capitalize on distressed assets afterward.</p><p>It's why we're seeing this flight to safety, the gold rush, the repositioning of capital. Money is being moved by people who recognize the gap between rhetoric and outcomes. Much of it is wait and see. </p><p>This (maybe) orchestrated slowdown may or may not pan out for the administration&#8217;s goals, but the real-world stakes compounded by an AI revolution are monumental for workers, businesses, and global stability alike. A bell has been rung. </p><p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or recommendation for any investment.

A lot of it is generational cycling - every older generation thinks the younger generation doesn&#8217;t work hard enough, doesn&#8217;t care enough, etc. And maybe the smartphones have gigafried everyone.

When I talk to young people from New York or Louisiana or Tennessee or California or DC or Indiana or Massachusetts about their futures, they're not just worried about finding jobs, they're worried about whether or not the whole concept of a "career" as we know it will exist in five years.

And Covid is a good demarcation between the generations, with it having a profound impacts on <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10242215/">development</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nations-report-card-us-kids-reading-math-skills-pandemic-era-losses-continue/#:~:text=Washington%20&#8212;%20America's%20children%20have%20continued,as%20the%20nation's%20report%20card.">literacy</a>. But the Covid experience was also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/08/31/generation-z-and-new-technologys-effect-on-culture/">shaped by technology</a>, right? </p><ul><li><p><strong>Isolation</strong>: Smart phones and <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2024/gen-z-and-technology-the-impact-on-workplace-readiness/">AI</a> are fundamentally reshaping Gen Z&#8217;s understanding of <a href="https://johnsoncenter.org/blog/financial-stress-and-philanthropic-influence-the-precarious-promise-of-generation-z/">the economy and wealth built in it</a> and who they become in the process. I think everything in Rachel&#8217;s graphic boils down to (1) the isolation that the pandemic caused and the role of technology and (2) how that isolation and technology formed how we interact with the economy. </p></li><li><p><strong>Social media:</strong> When TikTok/the creator economy started gaining traction in the late 2010s, it wasn&#8217;t really a &#8216;<em>career</em>&#8217; yet. There were YouTubers and professional newsletter writers, but Covid created the moment that truly <em>anyone</em> could be a star and reshaped how the younger generations think about work (especially in post-pandemic era <a href="https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2022/09/73--of-gen-z-say-economic-environment-has-made-it-more-challengi.html">inflation and price pressures</a>).</p></li></ul><p>When a main path to financial security comes through the algorithmic gods rather than institutional advancement (like when a single viral TikTok can generate <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/tiktok-earning-stats">more income</a> than a year of professional work) it fundamentally changes how people view everything from education to social structures to political systems that they&#8217;re apart of.</p><h3>The 3 Gen Z&#8217;s</h3><p>I think there are three groups of Gen Z, all of whom have<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_gap"> fundamentally different relationships to digital reality</a>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gen Z 1.0: The Bridge Generation:</strong> This group watched the digital transformation happen in real-time, experiencing both the analog and internet worlds during formative years. They might view technology as a tool rather than an environment. They're young enough to navigate digital spaces fluently but old enough to remember alternatives. They (myself included) entered the workforce during Covid and might have severe workplace interaction gaps because they missed out on formative time during their early <a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/dealing-with-difficult-people-daily/how-to-manage-difficult-staff-gen-z-edition/#:~:text=Among%20the%20respondents%2C%2049%25%20said,%2C%20and%20motivation%20(37%25).">years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gen Z 1.5: The Covid Cohort: </strong>This group hit major life milestones during a global pandemic. They entered college under Trump but graduated under Biden. This group has a particularly complex relationship with institutions. They watched traditional systems bend and break in real-time during Covid, while simultaneously seeing how digital infrastructure kept society functioning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gen Z 2.0: The Digital Natives: </strong>This is the first group that will be graduate into the new digital economy. This group has never known a world without smartphones. To them, social media could be another layer of reality. Their understanding of economic opportunity is completely different from their older peers. </p></li></ul><p>Think about AI. Gen Z 2.0 will have to see it as simply the water they swim in, whereas Gen Z 1.0 will remember a time of pre-digital stability. These are different relationships with digital reality, and these differences show up in everything from career choices to political alignments to basic assumptions about how the world works. <a href="https://www.generationtechblog.com/p/gen-z-really-does-have-a-work-ethic">Jean Twenge has a good summary</a> of how work has changed for the younger generations since Covid, highlighting post-pandemic burnout, reset of priorities when faced with death, a strong job market, and broad pessimism as a generation. </p><p>But to understand why these different groups of Gen Z respond so differently to our current moment, we need to examine the fundamental framework through which they view reality.</p><h3>How They See the World</h3><p>That&#8217;s the field that young people are playing in at the moment, and it creates a rocky economic landscape. It&#8217;s <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/fafonomics-how-chaos-became-americas">FAFOnomics</a> (embracing or creating chaos as a response to systemic instability) and it&#8217;s happening at the individual level too. It's not that they're more risk-tolerant, they're just responding rationally to a world where traditional "safe" choices feel increasingly risky. There&#8217;s a feedback loop.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Technology &#8594; Economics</strong> Every new platform creates its own economy. TikTok isn't just a social network, but it's a wealth generation machine that can turn attention into currency. When someone can make more from one viral video than their parent's monthly salary, it fundamentally reshapes how we understand value creation, especially in an era of dismantling government and changing workforces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economics &#8594; Identity</strong> Your relationship with money can become about how you see yourself in the world. The online world creates distinct tribes and each group can develop its own culture, internal language, and worldview. </p></li><li><p><strong>Identity &#8594; Technology</strong> How we see ourselves shapes how we use technology. Gen Z 2.0 doesn't just use digital tools differently, they understand reality through a digital-first lens. Their identity formation happens through and with technology.</p></li></ul><p>Think about crypto culture as an example:</p><ul><li><p>Technology enables new forms of value exchange, which creates new economic possibilities so people build identities around these possibilities and these identities drive development of new technologies and the cycle continues.</p></li></ul><p>Toby Shorin sort of touched on a similar idea in Life After Lifestyle, where <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/life-after-lifestyle/">consumption and platforms </a>drive identity. And when Boomers are like &#8220;How do I relate to Gen Z?&#8221; this is the core problem - different generations don&#8217;t just use different tools, they operate in different economic realities and form identity through fundamentally different processes. Technology is accelerating differentiation. Economic paths are becoming more extreme. Identity formation is becoming more fluid. </p><h3>The Barbell Strategy</h3><p>Responses to this digital reality and fast moving world create a version (somewhat) of <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/barbell-strategy">Taleb&#8217;s Barbell Strategy </a>- we increasingly have a world split between students (1) forgoing college to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/gen-z-trades-jobs-plumbing-welding-a76b5e43">pursue the trades</a> and (2) those gambling everything on digital moonshots. Taleb writes that the barbell strategy is a &#8220;method that consists of taking both a defensive attitude and an excessively aggressive one at the same time&#8221; - here, we see people doing maybe one or the other. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg" width="577" height="383.6098901098901" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:968,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:577,&quot;bytes&quot;:46378,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p1lL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1100ac-1f86-49db-a89e-8a41950a9f98_1500x997.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The barbell economy creates its own culture:</p><ul><li><p>There are "safety seekers" who might choose to skip the college debt trap, take steady jobs, and find identity in stability amid chaos.

They are the wealthiest generation <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boomers-wealthiest-generation-ever-lived-104103574.html">to have ever lived, </a>thanks to &#8220;affordable housing and strong equity markets&#8221; <a href="https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/insights/publications/allianz-global-wealth-report-2024/financial-assets-surprising-relief.html#:~:text=Projections%20indicate%20that%2C%20in%20the,from%20Baby%20Boomer%20households4.">according to Allianz.</a></p><p>It of course was (1) still hard (2) clearly doesn&#8217;t work for everyone, as 43% of Boomers have<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/12/31/rich-retired-boomers-fear-going-broke-study/"> no retirement savings</a> (perhaps an indictment of the move to 401k from pensions) and (3) is a broad sweeping generalization. </p><p>But the general formula that worked for a lot of people then was work hard, buy a house, save for retirement, trust in institutions. There was incredible shakeups, like the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/1970-stagflation.asp#:~:text=Stagflation%20in%20the%201970s%20was,currency%20rates%20contributed%20to%20stagflation.">stagflation of the 1970s</a> and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=mega+high+interest+rates+1980&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">mega-high interest rates of the 1980s</a>. But over time (and perhaps the same will happen for younger generations, it usually does) things smoothed out to an element of predictability.</p><h4>The Wealth Generation Shift</h4><p>But some of the Boomers that have benefited from this system have also participated in its dismantling. Not out of malice, but through thousands of small decisions that prioritized short-term gains over systemic stability. One example is the persistent public outcry at any attempt to build homes (as well as <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/why-we-have-a-housing-crisis">zoning</a>, etc, I&#8217;ve talked about it a lot), so housing has become an investment vehicle rather than shelter. </p><p>For many reasons, baby boomers still own most of the nation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/realestate/empty-nests-millennials-boomers.html#:~:text=A%20recent%20analysis%20by%20Redfin,as%20many%2C%20about%2014%20percent.">3-to-4 bedroom homes</a> - they own 38% of homes nationwide despite comprising just over <a href="https://constructioncoverage.com/research/baby-boomer-dominant-housing-markets">20% of the population.</a> Millennials haven&#8217;t caught up to Baby Boomer life marker homeownership rates and homeownership rates are even lower for Gen Z than Millennials at the same ages, according to<a href="https://youngamericans.berkeley.edu/2024/01/breaking-down-the-data-how-has-homeownership-varied-across-generations/"> a study out of Berkeley. </a>In 2025, the average Gen Z worker needs 14 years to save a home down payment, twice as long as Boomers. This isn&#8217;t frugality failure, it&#8217;s a system where 72.9% of wealth<a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/02/wealth-inequality-by-age-in-the-post-pandemic-era/"> sits with those over 55.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:73377,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AN2B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a817925-629a-495f-b65e-4c72b40f7693_1629x1086.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s also systemic issues, like education costs and healthcare costs skyrocketing.

focus on getting inflation down so the Fed can cut instead of enacting inflationary tariffs, but alas) and that&#8217;s unwieldy to manage too.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> None of these can be solved by taking an axe to the government, unless there is comfort with people dying. </p><h4>DOGE</h4><p>And to be clear, we <em>do</em> have a massive debt problem. But DOGE is having trouble finding actual fraud and <a href="https://x.com/krishnanrohit/status/1891644138770051421">keeps on making silly mistakes</a>. The Social Security fraud that DOGE uncovered<a href="https://x.com/devahaz/status/1891502238121505077"> is just a data problem </a>(which <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/death-stop-social-security-payments">should be fixed</a>, but again, <a href="https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/a-06-21-51022.pdf">money</a>) and the real problem with SSN is that <a href="https://x.com/AlexNowrasteh/status/1891499164812362141">people</a> actually use fake SSNs to work and pay taxes - <a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/checking-e-verify-costs-consequences-national-worker-screening-mandate">not to steal money</a>, but to <a href="https://x.com/JustinWolfers/status/1891501850643308806">pay into the system</a>. Also, we are not sending out billions of dollars to people aged 150. We have the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/benefits/ra_age202412.html">data</a>.</p><p>Our main headwind is that we have <a href="https://x.com/jmhorp/status/1891697365179887904">an aging population</a> and a demographic crisis. As <a href="https://x.com/Afinetheorem/status/1891699446892634582">Kevin Bryan</a> said the government &#8220;isn&#8217;t filled with fraud &#8211; it is almost all old age transfers and military and interest.&#8221; Also, saving money doesn&#8217;t always <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1892194230488973348">equate to efficiency. </a></p><h4>VATs</h4><p>There are other examples of policies that are confusing, like Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1891572283161944433">treating VATs (Value Added Taxes) as tariffs</a> and then putting reciprocal tariffs on countries that have a VAT. I&#8217;ve written at length about tariffs and produced <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/37o71HoqeI7uxi9bB3inYm?si=7e36519e51ff491f">an Indicator for Planet Money episode</a> about them. VATs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> do not impact American exporters. This is like getting upset that French people have to pay taxes on their stuff domestically<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a>. It doesn&#8217;t impact us. </p><p>Erica York, who is doing incredible work at the Tax Foundation, wrote about it <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-eu-vat-discriminatory/">here</a>. The VAT applies to <em>all</em> products sold in France, whether imported or domestic. The tariff <em>only </em>applies to imported products. </p><h4>Firings</h4><p>There has also been mass firings of FAA workers (who are going to be <a href="https://x.com/_rotimia/status/1891578340143747525">replaced by contract workers it seems</a>, mere days after the deadliest <a href="https://x.com/wideofthepost/status/1891331541281677507">commercial plane crash since 2009</a>). There was a firing and then rehiring of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3nrx1dq5o">nuclear safety workers.</a> There was a firing of people who<a href="https://x.com/FPWellman/status/1891500319324188744"> operate the Veterans Crisis Line, </a>people who take care of those who fought for our country. There was a firing of park rangers, who protects the beautiful spaces America has been <a href="https://x.com/Politics_PR/status/1890906702750290279">afforded</a>. There are many more examples.</p><p>275,000 people have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/federal-employee-firings-effects-trump-doge/">lost their jobs</a>, which is 10% of the federal workforce (and half of the job losses of<a href="https://x.com/wideofthepost/status/1890968169025622075"> Feb 2009</a>). One-third of all federal jobs are held by retired military. The <a href="https://x.com/theoluminati/status/1891233072877601143">&#8216;deep state&#8217; </a>seems to be civil servants who work at NIH and CFPB, who try to keep America somewhat<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-federal-tech-workers-facing-down"> safe from predatory financing and disease.</a> Again, no one was saying that there wasn&#8217;t waste, but at what cost? </p><p>The cost of rebuilding after so carelessly firing, rehiring, dismantling, could be enormous. Firing 25% of federal workers would reduce government spending by only 1%. Also, <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/02/17/repub/federal-workforce-hit-by-trumps-sweeping-firings-of-thousands-of-probationary-employees/#:~:text=The%20federal%20workforce%20is%20employed,New%20Mexico%2C%20Oklahoma%20and%20Oregon.">~80% of the Federal workforce</a> works outside DC. There are all sorts of <a href="https://x.com/JHWeissmann/status/1890532177198088209">lawsuits trying to slow all of this down</a>, but the erosion of trust has already taken place. Finally, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to square the concern over the national debt with the promise of more than $5 trillion in<a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1891087286189588969"> tax cuts</a>. On a different note, Andrew Ferguson, <a href="https://x.com/AFergusonFTC/status/1891882980165161297">the new head of the FTC</a>, actually plans to keep Lina Khan&#8217;s guidelines into effect.</p><h4>Geopolitics</h4><p>Then there are examples of isolationist policies, where the US is threatening other countries in a very real way. America has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11f121f9-391c-4597-93f7-f12894e1b79d">become adversarial to our allies</a>, especially Europe. The culture wars have gone global, and that puts other countries at risk if they stay entangled with the US. This is based on the rhetoric of <a href="https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1890692732676604386">JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a>, where he made it very clear how he hopes the <a href="https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1890730456095555878">US will position (and deposition) </a>itself. </p><p>I wrote at length last week about the geopolitical repositioning of the US (the move from a unipolar to a multipolar world) and Trump has offered Russia several concessions while<a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1891989532544815580"> blaming Ukraine for starting the war</a> (which is not true). It&#8217;s another sign of the US stepping down from <a href="https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1892074921679069555">its role as leader of the free world. </a></p><p>If we evaluate how others think of this just from a market perspective, European stocks<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-18/vance-speech-there-s-no-template-for-the-shock-europe-just-got?srnd=undefined"> have beaten the S&amp;P 500 by almost 10%</a> since Christmas. The two-year breakeven rate, what traders expect inflation to average over the next two years, is more than 3% (a bet that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-18/the-world-s-most-important-market-sends-inflation-warning?srnd=homepage-americas">inflation will accelerate)</a>. </p><p>Money tends to talk louder than words do. </p><h3>The Future</h3><p><a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-live-like-royalty-and-dont-know-it">Charles Mann wrote an excellent piece</a> about the luxury that the US has in &#8216;not knowing&#8217; - we truly don&#8217;t really know how anything works (which is a problem and that births conspiracy theories). He writes &#8220;they wanted a better world, but they didn&#8217;t know how this one worked.&#8221; </p><p>As any mechanic will tell you, you can&#8217;t fix a system unless you know how it functions. And that&#8217;s what the problem seems to be right now. We are seeing a systematic devaluation of institutional knowledge in favor of some form of misguided intuition with some quite far reaching <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/1891280686687854822">executive power.</a> I tweeted about <a href="https://x.com/kylascan/status/1891624199891915181">this</a> phenomenon and a lot of people responded with:</p><ol><li><p>Well, we are broke and we needed to do this </p></li><li><p>The bureaucrats need to be replaced and also were bad at their jobs and there are too many of them (the federal workforce has actually<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/07/what-the-data-says-about-federal-workers/#:~:text=In%20absolute%20terms%2C%20it%20has,2%2C405%2C100%20people%20in%20March%202024."> remained steady</a> as a % of the overall workforce)</p></li><li><p>Bill Clinton did mass firings<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a> - (he did, but he did it legally and with careful review, whereas the current approach is potentially <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1891456099435376648">unconstitutional</a> (Mike Pence, former VP, <a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-presidency-and-the-constitution/">has a good read on that here</a>) and apparently not what Trump&#8217;s voters<a href="https://x.com/cwebbonline/status/1890763030142836774"> actually wanted</a>)</p></li></ol><p>Twitter did do mass layoffs when Elon took over, and the<a href="https://x.com/devahaz/status/1890884988217823533"> app was totally fine</a> - it was buggy for a bit (and still is) but it&#8217;s an app that<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/"> 27% of the population uses.</a> It&#8217;s not the US government. Taking an axe to essential services probably isn&#8217;t the best way to go after waste and efficiency<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9" target="_self">9</a>. Subsequently privatizing those services <a href="https://x.com/DunkinDoubleCup/status/1891543173781971024">will also be costly</a>. </p><p>Domestically, there are two shocks created, <a href="https://x.com/DianeSwonk/status/1891116945895727156">as Diane Swonk wrote </a>- (1) massive uncertainty causing people to delay decisions and spending and (2) fear that prices will continue to rise, leading to hoarding. This palpable loss of direction has severe consequences for the economy, including potential stagflation. That&#8217;s why gold is on the move - uncertainty.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a> </p><p>Internationally, it&#8217;s a scattering of chess pieces. Singapore&#8217;s defense minister stated that the <a href="https://x.com/Birdyword/status/1891304778317136114">US has evolved from</a> &#8220;a liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent&#8221;. they're describing a shift in how power views its responsibility. And right now, the US doesn&#8217;t see that it has any responsibility at all. As <a href="https://x.com/EpsilonTheory/status/1891859044614189445">Ben Hunt said,</a> &#8220;it&#8217;s the pursuit of power for power&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p><p>Guess who is about to inherit this new <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/democrat-baby-bust-trump-population-decline/681619/">world</a>?</p><h3><strong>The Normal Trap</strong></h3><p>My former professor Dr. Chhachhi said "the opposite of rationality isn't irrationality - it's being normal&#8221;. He captured something really important. He didn&#8217;t mean this exactly, but I am extrapolating - the "safe path" (corporate job, 401k) might be the riskiest bet.</p><p>When AI can eliminate entire professional categories overnight, when traditional credentials lose value faster than you can earn them, when digital platforms can create overnight millionaires... the question is about how we define stability in an unstable world.</p><p>While Gen Z has adapted by finding alternative paths to success - from trades to creator economies - institutions are struggling to keep pace. Universities experiment with modular education, corporations are rethinking credential requirements, and policymakers push for reforms, but these changes are often too slow and too limited. The challenge isn't just modernization, it's legitimacy, right? When people say the government is "broke," they're not just talking about finances, they're talking about trust.</p><p>This is the core tension of our moment: Gen Z's <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051221086241">'algorithmized self' isn't</a> a choice&#8212;it's an adaptation to systems where viral moments outweigh career loyalty and where institutional stability has been replaced by algorithmic opportunity. The paths to wealth and meaning have been fundamentally restructured by technology. The reality we face is stark: crumbling institutions, a demographic crisis, and a federal workforce being dismantled (regardless of your views on if it&#8217;s good or bad, that&#8217;s what is happening). </p><p>When I talk to people across the country, their concerns are greater than traditional political divisions. They're wrestling with questions of identity, meaning, and community in a world where traditional narratives about success and stability no longer hold.</p><p>What looks like a conservative shift among young voters might actually be something more fundamental: a generation's attempt to navigate a world where institutions promise stability they can't deliver, where algorithms offer opportunity without security, and where the very nature of work and worth is being redefined. It&#8217;s constantly evolving, and it&#8217;s not just politics - it&#8217;s the very nature of self being called into question.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or recommendation for any investment.
